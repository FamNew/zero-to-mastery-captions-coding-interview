00:01.070 --> 00:04.380
You know yourself and how you learn best.

00:04.580 --> 00:07.400
This isn't a video of me just telling you how to learn.

00:07.520 --> 00:13.250
Instead I want to point out some things that may help you get the most out of this course based on how

00:13.340 --> 00:15.290
this course is structured.

00:15.290 --> 00:19.250
Think of this course as having two courses into one.

00:19.310 --> 00:25.920
The first part right over here is the non technical aspects of the interview.

00:25.930 --> 00:31.420
These are the skills that you will use throughout your career to get a leg up from the competition and

00:31.420 --> 00:36.820
make sure that you are able to optimize your chances of getting a well-paid job that you love.

00:36.820 --> 00:41.980
We're going to be talking about how to get more interviews and talk about all these topics right over

00:41.980 --> 00:44.070
here.

00:44.070 --> 00:47.780
We will also talk about non technical interview questions.

00:47.790 --> 00:53.700
The most common questions that we had asked in an interview and how to overcome them.

00:53.870 --> 00:56.940
And then finally talk about offer and negotiation.

00:57.200 --> 01:04.580
An often overlooked skill where we talk about how to handle offers and even negotiate a race.

01:04.610 --> 01:08.630
The second part of the Course is all technical.

01:08.790 --> 01:14.310
This is the really fun part of the course where we learn fundamental computer science topics that get

01:14.340 --> 01:19.210
asked at some of the top companies and don't lead this diagram intimidate you.

01:19.260 --> 01:22.550
By the end of the course you're going to master all these topics.

01:23.920 --> 01:31.360
We're going to learn about data structures like arrays stacks trees graphs and then specific ones like

01:31.690 --> 01:36.220
priority queues binary search tree doubly linked list.

01:36.220 --> 01:42.970
We're going to learn about algorithms how to traverse a tree and a graph how to use recursion properly

01:43.810 --> 01:47.150
how to improve time complexity and Big-O notation.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.860
How do we do sorting.

01:48.970 --> 01:55.240
Perhaps even searching all with the goal to help us write better code and answer interview questions

01:55.980 --> 02:01.840
what are my favorite sections here is when we're going to take you through a Google interview and demonstrate

02:01.900 --> 02:07.560
each piece of the puzzle so that by the end of it all you're able to answer really difficult questions

02:07.880 --> 02:10.150
as if you were part of that interview.

02:10.450 --> 02:15.130
By the end of it you're going to feel confident in any coding attribute or white board interview.

02:16.890 --> 02:22.140
At the end we're also going to have a ton of questions for you to do on top of the ones that we're going

02:22.140 --> 02:29.130
to do together from all these companies plus specific questions whether you want to be a front end engineer

02:29.160 --> 02:31.200
or a back end engineer.

02:31.200 --> 02:37.150
So you have three options with this course if you want you can just do each course separately.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.030
And that is fine.

02:39.050 --> 02:45.270
However the Course is structured in a way that these two courses are ordered to make you understand

02:45.330 --> 02:46.220
the topic.

02:46.290 --> 02:50.510
Bill the fundamentals and really connect the dots on interviewing.

02:50.670 --> 02:56.910
So to get the most out of this course you should follow the lessons in order since you may gain an insight

02:56.940 --> 02:59.950
or two even if you've got all leave me alone Andre.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.300
I already know this stuff.

03:01.620 --> 03:04.130
So now there you have an idea of the outline.

03:04.140 --> 03:09.190
Let's talk about what it means to succeed in this course first.

03:09.210 --> 03:14.850
Make sure you use our online discourse community to communicate with fellow students ask questions and

03:14.850 --> 03:18.380
talk about anything you may want when it comes to interviews.

03:18.390 --> 03:24.030
There's nothing better than talking out loud and practicing in front of people or with others.

03:24.030 --> 03:27.540
I'm also active every day on this community.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.540
The second part.

03:28.710 --> 03:31.110
These exercises get harder and harder.

03:31.170 --> 03:36.610
In each section they will challenge you and make you really extend your abilities as a developer.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.380
This is done on purpose.

03:39.400 --> 03:43.930
We're going to be building our foundation throughout the course and do challenging problems so that

03:43.990 --> 03:47.690
when it comes to real interviews you find things easy.

03:47.980 --> 03:54.550
Although I walk through the solutions I encourage you to use available resources to solve the answer.

03:54.550 --> 04:00.630
Think of it this way if someone offered you $10000 bonus to study interview questions for a month.

04:00.910 --> 04:02.540
Would you do it.

04:02.600 --> 04:08.290
That is why you're doing practicing for this by working hard and practicing what most people don't do.

04:08.450 --> 04:13.650
Interviewing you're putting yourself in a higher salary position for the rest of your life.

04:13.730 --> 04:14.540
A fair point.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.700
I know it sounds silly but it's important.

04:16.790 --> 04:22.170
Anytime you feel like you're just watching a video and aren't understanding a topic Stop what you're

04:22.190 --> 04:24.940
doing and take a break come back to the problem.

04:24.980 --> 04:27.510
You won't be able to finish this course in one week.

04:27.710 --> 04:33.560
If you do it properly it will take you about one month to finish everything in here so take your time.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.540
This isn't a sprint it's a marathon.

04:36.650 --> 04:41.340
Finally try to complete the full course instead of just parts of it.

04:41.360 --> 04:49.150
Most lessons are tied into one from another so that they flow and we keep building this pyramid of knowledge.

04:49.170 --> 04:53.130
We'll start from basic and get into more and more advanced topics.

04:53.950 --> 04:54.550
All right.

04:54.700 --> 04:59.880
I think it's time for us to start the course and get prepared to land our dream job.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.980
Let's get started and see in the next section.

05:03.020 --> 05:03.250
Buh-Bye.
