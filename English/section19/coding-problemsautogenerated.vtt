Walk them back I want to show you one of my favorite coding challenges that happens every year every

00:08.930 --> 00:10.560
Christmas in December.

00:10.580 --> 00:12.810
There's something called advent of code.

00:13.340 --> 00:19.970
And if you google advent of code you'll see that all the 2017 version comes but based on when you're

00:19.970 --> 00:23.260
watching the video there will be that 2018 version.

00:23.360 --> 00:30.470
But you can also go back in time and do the previous year's If you go to 2016.

00:30.470 --> 00:38.340
We see our 2016 version now as a community are 0 to mastery community on discord.

00:38.340 --> 00:46.160
Every December we tackled this challenge and try to solve coding problems for 25 days straight.

00:47.270 --> 00:52.700
And these are in my opinion some of the best logical problems they can solve with code.

00:52.770 --> 00:56.210
They're really really good and they get harder and harder each day.

00:57.410 --> 01:01.890
But the fun thing is that you'll have a community of people to do it with.

01:02.140 --> 01:07.870
And as you can see here there is somberness there's Hacker News communities that work together in our

01:07.870 --> 01:10.330
own community where we compare each other's code.

01:10.450 --> 01:12.870
See who came up with what solution.

01:13.150 --> 01:19.390
So I encourage you to do this even if it is in December but get ready because in December we're going

01:19.390 --> 01:23.610
to be doing this challenge together every December as a community.

01:23.790 --> 01:25.030
Happy advent of code.
