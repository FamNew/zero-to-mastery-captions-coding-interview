00:01.020 --> 00:08.760
What're the various operations that can be performed on different data structures because as we learned

00:08.790 --> 00:17.570
in our previous lectures data structures are simply ways to organize our data on our computers and the

00:17.570 --> 00:25.520
data structures that we'll see throughout this course are simply variations of how we stored this data

00:25.820 --> 00:27.350
on our computers.

00:27.350 --> 00:33.680
This information and each data structure has their tradeoffs.

00:33.730 --> 00:36.070
Some are good at certain operations.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.990
Others are good at other operations.

00:40.020 --> 00:47.430
One type of action that we're going to performed with data structures well is insertion add a new data

00:47.430 --> 00:56.220
item in a given collection of items such as us adding the apple item and memory here.

00:57.270 --> 01:05.300
And now the one file deletion we want to sometimes delete data such as remove mango from our list.

01:05.300 --> 01:08.800
Another type of action might be traversal.

01:09.140 --> 01:16.860
And we're going to see this a lot traversal simply means access each data item exactly once so that

01:17.190 --> 01:22.240
it can be processed and other useful one is searching.

01:22.310 --> 01:29.920
We want to find out the location of the data item if it exists in a given collection and then we also

01:29.920 --> 01:34.960
have things like sorting that is having data that is sorting.

01:34.960 --> 01:41.890
Kind of like it is on the left hand side over here versus the right hand side where there's not much

01:41.890 --> 01:45.100
sorting going on at least from where we can see.

01:45.300 --> 01:51.390
And obviously the main one and probably the most important is access.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.170
How do we access this data that we have on our computer.

01:56.950 --> 02:02.980
Now each data structure that we're going to go through in this course will have different pros and cons

02:02.980 --> 02:04.950
for each one of these.

02:05.140 --> 02:12.240
And if we take a look at our big-O Chichi Well we're very familiar with this diagram over here or this

02:12.240 --> 02:19.510
graph and if we scroll down we have all these data structures that it lists and don't get to overwhelm.

02:19.590 --> 02:25.170
We're going to go over most of these data structures and you see that half of them are mainly trees

02:25.200 --> 02:31.300
and variation of trees and within here we see that each one of them has access.

02:31.310 --> 02:38.510
Search insertion deletion average in worst case and because we understand big-O we can see that.

02:38.620 --> 02:41.660
All right we're seeing which ones good for what.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.080
And what is bad for what.

02:44.910 --> 02:50.590
And as we go through our data structures we're going to go over these pros and cons so that you build

02:50.590 --> 02:57.310
the foundation to be able to decide which data structure should I use on your next problem.

02:57.730 --> 03:02.080
We're going to get started with our very first data structure in the next lÃ¶sen.

03:02.200 --> 03:02.990
I'll see in that one.
