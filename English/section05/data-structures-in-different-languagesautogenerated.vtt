Welcome back there are quite a few data structures that you may be asked in an interview and we saw

00:07.470 --> 00:10.150
how many of them there are on that Wikipedia page.

00:10.320 --> 00:14.760
But luckily for you the list isn't actually that intimidating.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.420
All you need to learn are these swans over here.

00:18.420 --> 00:21.380
These are used I would say 90 percent of the time.

00:21.540 --> 00:25.310
And this is what we're going to talk about in our course.

00:25.350 --> 00:30.800
Now there may be specific ones within these groups and each one of them has tradeoffs.

00:30.990 --> 00:36.780
But as long as you learn these and you learn when and why you should use them then you're going to be

00:36.780 --> 00:38.570
miles ahead of most people.

00:38.790 --> 00:41.160
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:42.490 --> 00:44.400
Now before we get going.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.870
I want to note one last thing.

00:47.020 --> 00:56.530
You see each language has their own datatypes or built in datatypes javascript for example has numbers

00:57.190 --> 01:09.570
strings has booleans which are true false and then some strange ones like undefined and each language

01:09.570 --> 01:15.150
has data structures to organize these datatypes.

01:15.150 --> 01:23.960
So for example in javascript we have arrays and objects that we use and they are data types.

01:23.970 --> 01:32.250
It allows us to structure and organize information such as our primitive data types or even hold more

01:32.250 --> 01:38.760
complex ones like having an array that contains multiple objects and we're going to talk about this

01:38.760 --> 01:39.660
in more detail.

01:39.750 --> 01:47.730
But I want to show you that we do have different languages that have different access to some data structures.

01:47.790 --> 01:55.080
You can see over here some of the other languages that we can use in this course and whether they have

01:55.080 --> 01:56.230
them available.

01:56.310 --> 02:07.010
We see that Java has arrays has linked lists stacks we have priority queues and many other types.

02:07.090 --> 02:14.540
Now does that mean that if we're using javascript we can only use arrays and objects.

02:15.270 --> 02:22.050
Well no not really although these languages come with data structures built in.

02:22.050 --> 02:30.690
We can also built our own and most languages have enough data structures and data types for us to build

02:31.740 --> 02:33.770
and create our own data structures.

02:34.690 --> 02:44.580
So if javascript doesn't have stacks Well we can build one now to finish this section and finally dive

02:44.580 --> 02:47.280
into our first data structure.

02:47.300 --> 02:53.480
I wanted to just remind you that we have a little map over here of what we need to know for the coding

02:53.480 --> 02:54.470
interview.

02:54.470 --> 03:02.090
Now in this map I have a little present emoji next to each one of the data structures that we're going

03:02.090 --> 03:02.930
to talk about.

03:03.930 --> 03:10.260
As you can see there aren't that many of them and many of them are quite related or are children of

03:10.260 --> 03:17.600
the other but use this as a reference for you to just draw a map of how things are connected and what

03:17.600 --> 03:19.650
the data structures are that we're going to talk about.

03:20.570 --> 03:24.870
But let's get our hands dirty with our first data structure.

03:24.950 --> 03:26.280
I'll see in the next one.

03:26.600 --> 03:26.820
Babai.
