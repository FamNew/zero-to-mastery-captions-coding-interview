00:01.230 --> 00:12.540
One is a data structure a data structure is a collection of values algorithms are the steps or processes

00:12.540 --> 00:16.550
we put into place to manipulate these collection of values.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.160
It's what allows us to write programs.

00:21.460 --> 00:29.770
A person who knows how data structures and algorithms work and how to use them can write programs great

00:29.770 --> 00:31.440
programs.

00:31.440 --> 00:38.910
The beauty is that these are timeless no matter what programming language you use whether you prefer

00:39.090 --> 00:46.920
one library over the other whether you write code in angular or react in the front end development world

00:47.400 --> 00:49.440
or you are a game developer.

00:49.740 --> 00:54.360
Underneath it all it's all data structures and algorithms.

00:54.360 --> 01:01.310
If you understand this then you can really easily adapt and tackle all sorts of technical problems.

01:02.160 --> 01:10.770
It is why companies like Facebook Amazon Netflix Google ask questions specific to data structures and

01:10.770 --> 01:18.090
algorithms because although it may be important to know the latest and greatest javascript syntax or

01:18.150 --> 01:26.610
maybe the latest and greatest library those things change if you know the fundamentals so then they

01:26.610 --> 01:31.700
can throw you any problem any situation any you are able to make the right decision.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.560
This knowledge is extremely valuable.

01:34.650 --> 01:40.770
The longer you are in the field the more and more you realize that you need these fundamental principles

01:40.800 --> 01:46.270
of data structures and algorithms in order to be a great developer or engineer.

01:46.350 --> 01:47.900
So let's get started with that.

01:48.090 --> 01:54.030
Over the next few sections we have a long way to go to get familiar with data structures and algorithms.

01:54.030 --> 01:54.710
So I'm right.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.110
Great programs.

01:56.220 --> 01:57.100
Let's get started.
