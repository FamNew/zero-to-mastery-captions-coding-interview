Welcome to what is a data structure a data structure is a collection of values the values can have relationships

00:11.880 --> 00:15.690
among them and they can have functions applied to them.

00:15.710 --> 00:21.970
Each one is different in what it can do and what it is best used for.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.260
Most important thing to take away is that each data structure is good and is specialized for its own

00:30.260 --> 00:31.750
thing.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.470
All right Andre you just said a bunch of words and I don't really understand.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.480
Well let's show you a couple of images to simplify this.

00:41.650 --> 00:50.570
You see can think of data structures as any sort of compartment or container a data structure is simply

00:50.570 --> 00:53.180
a file cabinet of different types.

00:53.330 --> 01:00.320
You have a backpack a place where you put maybe your school books you have drawers where you pull your

01:00.320 --> 01:08.230
clothes fridge where you put your food a folder for your files and a packing box maybe for your toys.

01:09.880 --> 01:17.410
Each one of these containers are useful for it's own thing for example I'm not going to put my food

01:17.440 --> 01:22.170
in a drawer over here because that yogurt is going to go bad here.

01:23.170 --> 01:32.710
Likewise I'm not going to put all my papers and files in my backpack or perhaps a toy box because it's

01:32.710 --> 01:34.360
just going to get crumpled up.

01:34.390 --> 01:40.870
Each one of these containers are specific for it's own thing and that's what data structure really is.

01:40.960 --> 01:48.370
It's a way for us to organize data so that we can go into the backpack and retrieve that data really

01:48.370 --> 01:48.930
easily.

01:48.940 --> 01:54.940
We can go into the fridge and grab that popsicle or ice cream really fast.

01:55.060 --> 02:00.670
We can put things in data structures and we can take things from data structures and that's all it really

02:00.670 --> 02:01.420
is.

02:02.420 --> 02:08.990
And there are a ton of data structures just like in our real life how we have all these containers hold

02:08.990 --> 02:11.000
these places to put things in.

02:11.110 --> 02:14.900
In programming we have a ton of them.

02:14.980 --> 02:21.500
If we go to Wikipedia for example while if we scroll through here we see a ton of data structures.

02:21.610 --> 02:28.060
And this is going to look overwhelming but don't worry most of these while I've never encountered myself

02:28.090 --> 02:30.240
and they're very very specific.

02:30.400 --> 02:36.190
You probably only have about five or six data structures that are really really important that we're

02:36.190 --> 02:39.900
going to go over.

02:39.980 --> 02:45.810
You may have even heard of Bitcoin and how to use is block chain technology.

02:45.830 --> 02:54.400
This magical word will block Shane at the end of the day is simply a data structure a way to hold information

02:57.290 --> 03:06.290
so in our programming world data structures we can store things like numbers strings boolean types just

03:06.290 --> 03:13.950
like we saw when we coded in Javascript with arrays and objects arrays and objects in javascript.

03:13.950 --> 03:19.350
How are each a form of a data structure that allows us to store information.

03:19.510 --> 03:22.910
You see as humans this is what we do on Earth.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.770
Right.

03:23.950 --> 03:29.150
We take the chaos and the disorder and make order out of it.

03:29.350 --> 03:33.690
At least we try to we organize our farms to produce food.

03:33.850 --> 03:40.030
We package the food and we deliver them to the grocery stores and organize them in the grocery store

03:40.030 --> 03:48.280
so that humans can grab those and can then purchase these groceries and give money to put in a compartment

03:48.370 --> 03:51.930
and a bank that's all programs are we're modeling.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.500
Real life scenarios.

03:54.530 --> 04:01.280
And the more advanced a developer you become the more time you will start thinking and spending time

04:01.880 --> 04:04.130
talking about data structures.

04:04.130 --> 04:08.590
This is why interviewers love to talk about data structures.

04:08.670 --> 04:13.790
Now as I always like to mention there are always tradeoffs.

04:13.910 --> 04:16.790
Every programming question has a tradeoff.

04:16.790 --> 04:24.490
Remember are three pillars of readability memory and speed.

04:24.490 --> 04:26.910
When we talked about what code is best.

04:26.950 --> 04:29.680
Well we have the same thing with data structures.

04:29.770 --> 04:34.210
One is better than the other in some aspects and the other better than the other.

04:34.210 --> 04:35.240
That's why they exist.

04:35.320 --> 04:42.780
Each won for its own specific case and there are two parts to understanding data structures.

04:43.730 --> 04:46.150
One is how to actually build one.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.710
How can we build with code.

04:48.710 --> 04:56.270
Some of these data structures and two is how to use them how to use these data structures.

04:56.300 --> 05:02.490
We're going to do both of these in this course but the second point is the most important right.

05:02.600 --> 05:12.280
Because data structures are usually just tools and most of the time they're already pre-built for us

05:13.030 --> 05:18.310
the most important part is how to use them when to use one over the other and we kind of saw a little

05:18.310 --> 05:24.850
bit of that in the previous section when we talked about how to solve problems where we used an object

05:25.060 --> 05:29.570
versus an array to make our code more efficient.

05:30.840 --> 05:35.880
The goal in this course is to understand data structure so that you can pick the right data structure

05:35.880 --> 05:36.750
for your problem.

05:37.750 --> 05:42.790
Based on different scenarios data needs to be stored in a specific format.

05:42.790 --> 05:49.030
We have a handful of data structures that cover our need to store data in different formats.

05:49.170 --> 05:52.320
So let's get a little bit deeper into this topic.
