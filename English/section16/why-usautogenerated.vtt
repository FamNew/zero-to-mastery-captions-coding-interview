00:00.720 --> 00:05.360
This is a nother question that gets asked a lot why us.

00:05.370 --> 00:06.980
Why do you want to work for us.

00:06.990 --> 00:09.960
Why did you choose our company.

00:09.960 --> 00:15.720
A question that gets asked every time and any question that gets asked every time you should be very

00:15.720 --> 00:16.320
prepared for it.

00:16.320 --> 00:22.130
This is where you shine and you really have an answer that blows them out of the water.

00:22.140 --> 00:26.070
The key here is to make the interviewer feel special.

00:27.580 --> 00:34.650
Make them feel that this is your top choice and that this is where you see a long career for yourself.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.600
They don't want to hire somebody that's going to be there just for a year.

00:37.660 --> 00:43.960
They want somebody who really wants this job and is willing to dedicate years of their life growing

00:44.170 --> 00:45.590
with the company.

00:45.840 --> 00:53.260
So make them feel special make the interviewer feel that you really really like this company you admire

00:53.280 --> 00:58.820
this company and also that you respect the fact that they worked.

00:58.850 --> 01:05.480
This is the classic question where you can give a very generic answer that everybody says and you won't

01:05.480 --> 01:06.060
stand out.

01:06.120 --> 01:11.740
And remember interviewing is all about standing out not doing what everybody else does.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.260
So a typical answer to a question like this.

01:14.600 --> 01:20.390
Well a really bad answer to a question like this will be something along the lines of Well I just saw

01:20.390 --> 01:26.800
you guys on Linked In and I needed a job to make money.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.790
That is a terrible answer.

01:28.880 --> 01:37.230
So never say that a better answer is something along the lines of Well you know I've been researching

01:37.230 --> 01:43.770
your company for a while and I noticed that you're doing some work on X and I have myself I've done

01:43.770 --> 01:49.520
some work in the past similar to this and this is what I learned about it.

01:49.770 --> 01:54.470
And then you can go on with that and then you can say something along the lines of.

01:54.690 --> 02:00.580
And I think the problem of X is really interesting and I think it's something that I can add value to

02:00.600 --> 02:05.550
but also learn and become better at.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.390
And again this is just an example.

02:08.550 --> 02:12.690
But the idea here is that you're going to blow them out of the water.

02:12.720 --> 02:19.860
They expect you to give a generic answer but instead you talk about a specific problem.

02:19.920 --> 02:25.880
You talk about the fact that you did your research perhaps you talked to other developers on at that

02:25.920 --> 02:32.790
company through Linked-In or you read one of their recent blog posts and you understand what kind of

02:32.790 --> 02:34.620
problems they're trying to solve.

02:34.620 --> 02:39.660
You answered this question by demonstrating that you have those skills.

02:39.660 --> 02:45.220
You mentioned some of the key words that they have in the job description but also demonstrate that

02:45.220 --> 02:49.220
you're not like the rest that just wants a job and they're applying to a ton of companies.

02:50.530 --> 02:57.220
Tell them that you specifically search companies and found this company interesting because of the type

02:57.220 --> 02:58.600
of work they do.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.090
It shows that you want to grow.

03:00.250 --> 03:05.650
And it also demonstrates that you'll be great for this job because you've worked with some of their

03:05.710 --> 03:07.050
problems in the past.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.830
And this might remind you of.

03:09.960 --> 03:10.430
Yes.

03:10.530 --> 03:17.130
The four heroes you talk about the technical aspects and how you worked on similar things that they're

03:17.130 --> 03:18.150
looking for.

03:18.150 --> 03:24.270
It shows that you're the type of person who is successful because well you're actually going out and

03:24.270 --> 03:30.230
researching and and not just applying to companies blindly and waiting for any company to accept you.

03:31.200 --> 03:37.050
It also demonstrates leadership because you went out on your own and read their blog post talked to

03:37.050 --> 03:42.900
their developers to make sure that you understand what the company's needs are and then also talks about

03:42.900 --> 03:47.900
challenge how you worked on similar problems and you overcame them or you think it can help.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.520
And by this point you just start to see a pattern.

03:51.660 --> 03:54.620
We're always trying to use the four heroes.

03:54.750 --> 04:01.790
We're always trying to stand out and we're always trying to be the best version of ourself to the interviewer.

04:01.800 --> 04:07.140
Now before I end this video I want to add a quick note here and that is part of the question might come

04:07.140 --> 04:12.790
with the follow up question by the interviewer which is why did you leave your job.

04:12.960 --> 04:13.980
Why do you want to work for us.

04:13.980 --> 04:19.910
Why is your last job not good enough for you that you want to move.

04:20.310 --> 04:21.990
Everybody has different answers.

04:22.440 --> 04:27.870
But the one thing that you want to be careful of is no negativity.

04:28.140 --> 04:34.530
They don't want to hear you complain about your coworkers your boss the ugly codebase that your last

04:34.530 --> 04:35.350
company had.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.700
Be as positive as possible.

04:37.770 --> 04:39.170
Just say that you want to grow.

04:39.180 --> 04:45.040
You want more challenge you want to work with people that are really smart like they have at this company.

04:45.210 --> 04:46.260
No negativity.

04:46.260 --> 04:49.390
Be as positive as possible and show how you just want to grow.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.020
You just want to learn from the best.

04:52.090 --> 04:59.240
Work with the best and you are the type of person that can be put in any situation to succeed.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.910
And at this moment this company is your answer.

05:03.980 --> 05:05.790
I'll see you in the next one.
