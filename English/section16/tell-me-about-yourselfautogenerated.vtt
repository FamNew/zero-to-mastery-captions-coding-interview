00:01.600 --> 00:06.340
A question that you're going to get asked at every interview that you do.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.070
Tell me about yourself.

00:08.140 --> 00:09.820
What should you say.

00:10.420 --> 00:14.500
And I'm going to leave this on the screen so you can just read it on your own.

00:14.710 --> 00:19.580
But this is something that should be already prepared and you're ready to answer.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.980
And really nail it how can we answer this question successfully.

00:25.080 --> 00:31.260
You see this is the chance for you to steer the conversation in the direction that you want in the prepared

00:31.260 --> 00:32.210
stories.

00:32.430 --> 00:39.420
Of the four heroes that you want remember you're going to direct the rest of the conversation after

00:39.420 --> 00:45.320
they ask you this question to why you want them to ask you so you can shine some of the key takeaways

00:45.330 --> 00:45.690
here.

00:45.780 --> 00:48.600
You want to answer this question in about a minute.

00:48.690 --> 00:55.830
If you go too long into it while the interviewer is going to get bored and if you go too short then

00:55.890 --> 00:58.860
they don't get enough of a chance to get to know you.

00:58.860 --> 01:07.530
The key here is for you to tell your hero's journey how you went from very little skill to somebody

01:07.530 --> 01:09.090
that they want to hire.

01:09.090 --> 01:15.590
Think of it like a movie you want to talk about your triggers of success within this minute.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.100
You want to demonstrate that you're a successful person.

01:18.210 --> 01:25.500
You also want to slightly discuss maybe your past projects your past companies so that you get asked

01:25.500 --> 01:31.130
questions about these projects or passed companies by the interviewer because keep in mind the interviewer

01:31.130 --> 01:34.420
is going to ask follow up questions based on this.

01:34.800 --> 01:42.390
And when you talk about yourself maybe it's interesting that you were an origami master five years ago

01:42.660 --> 01:45.210
but it might not matter to the interviewer.

01:45.210 --> 01:50.530
So make sure that your stories your hero's journey is relevant to the job.

01:50.550 --> 01:55.800
And you mentioned some of the skills that you're going to be working with at this job within this minute.

01:55.800 --> 02:03.570
You want to demonstrate that do be extremely lucky to have you and how everything you've done in the

02:03.570 --> 02:07.360
past makes this a perfect role for you.

02:07.710 --> 02:15.660
And keep in mind that an interviewer may not have even looked at your resume so have a story prepared.

02:16.730 --> 02:23.240
Something difficult you did and why you did to solve that and what impact it had.

02:23.390 --> 02:28.310
You don't need to talk about your life story how you went to elementary school and high school.

02:28.310 --> 02:30.820
Just keep it short and to the point.

02:30.830 --> 02:34.150
But make sure you stand out from the crowd.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.060
Everybody might be able to code in Javascript.

02:37.280 --> 02:40.370
But what did you do that makes you stand up.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.720
And that's something that you're going to have to answer on your own.

02:43.730 --> 02:47.000
Keep in mind that this type of question there's different variations on it.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.230
Some people ask.

02:48.320 --> 02:55.490
Walk me through your resume or why are you leaving your current job or many other variations.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.610
Essentially they want to hear the story of why you're here.

02:58.610 --> 03:03.980
And as an example here's what I would say if let's say you have zero experience so you just tie yourself

03:03.980 --> 03:07.130
to code and this is your first job interview.

03:07.280 --> 03:12.480
You can say something along the lines of well I get really interested in coding.

03:12.540 --> 03:18.600
A couple of years back when I would start this small little side businesses and I would hire developers

03:19.110 --> 03:28.010
and designers to build a web site or an app for me and it was always a block box where I would pay this

03:28.050 --> 03:33.070
developer money and they'll come back with a product that I was never fully satisfied for.

03:33.090 --> 03:38.910
So I started teaching myself how to code because I wanted to know how this black box works.

03:38.940 --> 03:44.880
And the more I learned the more I learned I became really interested really in golf in the programming

03:44.880 --> 03:51.120
landscape and I just started consuming as much information as I can practicing as much as I can.

03:51.120 --> 03:57.290
I started building projects and then this is where you can talk about some of your big portfolio projects

03:57.750 --> 04:05.300
and all of a sudden I started writing blog posts about technical subjects that got received very well

04:05.690 --> 04:11.130
and I guess what I'm trying to say is that through these projects and through these posts every day

04:11.130 --> 04:17.040
I'm becoming better and better as a coder to the point that now I feel very confident and being able

04:17.040 --> 04:23.970
to be a valuable asset to your team not just now but even a year from now where I expect my skills to

04:24.030 --> 04:26.420
exponentially grow.

04:26.530 --> 04:32.530
And this is just an example that I came up with at the top of my head but you see here how I touched

04:32.530 --> 04:38.470
on all three points shows that I'm successful that I've had past businesses in the past how I've taught

04:38.470 --> 04:41.310
myself how to code because of an interest that I had.

04:41.330 --> 04:44.380
So I'm the type of person who's a go getter.

04:44.410 --> 04:47.290
I also mentioned a few things I want to ghast such as.

04:47.400 --> 04:53.690
Both written maybe projects have worked on my personal projects that I've put into my portfolio and

04:53.680 --> 04:59.230
I also talked about skills relevant to the job maybe this was a position related to web development

04:59.380 --> 05:01.430
or building an app.

05:01.610 --> 05:03.040
And this is something you can tweak.

05:03.050 --> 05:06.490
But the key thing is to have this prepared.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.630
And remember you want to stand out.

05:08.630 --> 05:14.690
Don't say things that all the other developers are saying or programmers are saying if you did something

05:14.690 --> 05:20.420
amazing in your life even if it isn't coding related try to work it into the interview.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.700
And that way you will be more memorable.

05:22.760 --> 05:27.800
And this is going to set the stage for the rest of the energy so good luck out there and I'll see in

05:27.800 --> 05:28.850
the next video.

05:29.120 --> 05:29.420
Buh-Bye.
