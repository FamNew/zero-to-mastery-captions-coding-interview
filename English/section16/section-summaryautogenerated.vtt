00:00.790 --> 00:01.350
All right.

00:01.390 --> 00:09.400
And that's it for the interviewing and the non technical questions I know it's not the most exciting

00:09.400 --> 00:10.000
section.

00:10.030 --> 00:14.380
It's a lot of me just talking but I hope you see a pattern here.

00:14.470 --> 00:21.010
Once you learn this it becomes easy because you can use this technique over and over and over throughout

00:21.010 --> 00:24.220
your career at whatever interviews you want.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.850
That's the beauty of non-technical questions.

00:26.920 --> 00:31.410
They're generally the same and all stay the same for many more years to come.

00:31.630 --> 00:34.390
So once you become good at them then you're all set.

00:34.690 --> 00:38.820
But let's just do a quick review of what we've learned.

00:38.860 --> 00:44.640
We first learned that you want to have a good mindset when going into an interview you want to be confident.

00:44.650 --> 00:46.090
You want to be relaxed.

00:46.090 --> 00:49.530
You also want to realize you're using the interviewers time.

00:49.690 --> 00:52.390
So don't make this a boring meeting for them.

00:52.390 --> 00:56.030
Bring the energy and have a two way conversation with them.

00:56.050 --> 01:02.290
They don't want to be sitting with the scared worried timid interviewer with low energy.

01:02.380 --> 01:05.420
That is quite have conversation.

01:05.430 --> 01:10.250
Be human Don't be a robot and interact with the interviewer in psychology.

01:10.250 --> 01:16.460
There's something called primacy effect and that is we remember the first and last impressions best.

01:16.680 --> 01:21.330
So when you enter the room be energetic be excited make a good impression.

01:21.420 --> 01:28.320
And when you leave the interview in the final minutes also and on a strong note have a strong closing

01:28.320 --> 01:30.190
argument of why they should hire you.

01:31.010 --> 01:37.940
And keep in mind that we always want to have our four heroes stories that include these four heroes

01:38.210 --> 01:42.630
in our answers because this is what interviewers are looking for.

01:42.890 --> 01:47.750
And keep in mind just because you feel like you're having a bad interview it doesn't necessarily mean

01:47.750 --> 01:51.950
that you're not going to get the job or you're not competing against the right answer or you're competing

01:51.950 --> 01:57.540
against other candidates who may struggle throughout the interview just like you.

01:57.610 --> 02:02.200
I also want to show you a neat little tool that may come in handy for you.

02:03.980 --> 02:09.470
This is a Web site that we're going to talk about in the offer and negotiation section Glassdoor and

02:09.530 --> 02:15.560
glass doors allow you to look at companies what employers are saying about them but they also have a

02:15.560 --> 02:21.500
new interviews section where you can actually search a company and see what sort of interviews they

02:21.500 --> 02:22.290
ask.

02:22.760 --> 02:31.450
So you can use this as a way to prepare and practice if the company is listed on this website you see

02:31.740 --> 02:32.430
in life.

02:32.430 --> 02:40.080
Success comes to those who are able to stand out and do the extra step that 99 percent of the people

02:40.230 --> 02:41.390
aren't willing to do.

02:41.610 --> 02:43.390
It's why you're taking the course.

02:43.410 --> 02:45.590
Most people don't practice for interviews.

02:45.720 --> 02:54.990
If we look at this in this way we notice a big factor when interviewed on top of working on coding questions

02:55.320 --> 03:00.960
data structures and algorithms that we cover in this course you should also work on par that don't often

03:01.200 --> 03:03.420
get attention from people.

03:03.450 --> 03:09.300
These are the non-technical questions where people want to find out whether you can speak to people

03:09.300 --> 03:10.060
on your team.

03:10.230 --> 03:16.860
You can communicate with clients and customers and coworkers whether you're able to focus on prioritizing

03:16.860 --> 03:19.510
tasks and not getting stuck solving a problem.

03:20.330 --> 03:25.970
Whether you need hand-holding or you're able to be independent and solve problems on your own because

03:26.030 --> 03:30.400
at the end interview process asks one big question.

03:30.590 --> 03:34.080
If I hire you will you make my life easier.

03:34.430 --> 03:35.170
That's it.

03:35.480 --> 03:43.210
If you're able to make somebody's life easier and offer a big value then you're going to be hired.

03:43.280 --> 03:49.450
People want to hire developers and programmers that will help their business grow and saves them time.

03:49.610 --> 03:52.170
So be that candidate and be that person.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.120
I'll see in the next section.
