00:01.530 --> 00:07.810
Welcome back let's talk about another question I get asked a lot in interviews.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.810
Tell me about a problem that you had and how you overcame it and or how you solved it.

00:14.810 --> 00:16.880
Again a very common question.

00:16.970 --> 00:18.130
How do you answer this.

00:18.470 --> 00:20.950
Well we should know this by now.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.350
They should be prepared.

00:22.510 --> 00:27.040
We should be ready when they ask this question or any variation of this type of question.

00:27.980 --> 00:34.940
Ideally you have a big project from a past company that you work with or a personal project that you

00:34.940 --> 00:36.050
can answer this with.

00:36.140 --> 00:42.500
Again going back to our portfolio and how we want to have wanted to big projects so we can answer questions

00:42.500 --> 00:45.220
like these and also impress the interviewer.

00:45.320 --> 00:51.200
And now with these type of questions we want to use something called the SAR method as a our method

00:51.760 --> 00:55.990
that is situation action and result.

00:56.260 --> 01:02.740
When asked this question we start off with the situation we tell the interviewer This is how the project

01:02.740 --> 01:03.250
was.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.700
This is the problem that we had.

01:06.070 --> 01:07.610
This is a situation.

01:08.020 --> 01:09.820
The second part is the action.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.010
What did you do to solve that situation.

01:13.030 --> 01:17.610
I did this high wrote a piece of software What did you do.

01:17.740 --> 01:20.020
How did you try and solve.

01:20.110 --> 01:24.910
And then the result is what happened after you took that action.

01:24.970 --> 01:33.280
The number of users increased the performance of the website improved so Sarr situation action result.

01:33.310 --> 01:39.590
This shows exactly what the problem is why you did with the problem and how you solved.

01:40.030 --> 01:43.670
And you see over here the second point we want to have metrics and numbers.

01:43.690 --> 01:47.680
If you're able to give numbers to the interviewer It sounds impressive.

01:47.680 --> 01:53.340
If I say I improve the performance of a web site or I increase the number of users.

01:53.530 --> 01:59.770
That doesn't sound impressive versus saying something like the Web site performance improved by 50 percent

02:00.250 --> 02:08.580
or we increased our monthly active users by 30 percent again something that you can prepare ahead of

02:08.580 --> 02:10.830
time in your stories.

02:10.950 --> 02:18.960
This is why when I talked about the portfolios we want to focus on big projects versus many small projects

02:19.170 --> 02:25.290
because when you get asked this question and your problem is that you had a difficult time building

02:25.320 --> 02:30.770
a To Do list app or a small little app it's not going to sound impressive.

02:30.780 --> 02:32.490
That's what everybody else does.

02:32.610 --> 02:39.540
Instead talk about a real problem and that's something that we've built in past courses where we talked

02:39.540 --> 02:48.420
about difficult problems as caching scaling performance security and these three over here scaling performance

02:48.420 --> 02:56.070
security are really really good things to talk about if you're able to use one of these of how you improve

02:56.070 --> 03:01.140
security how you improved performance how you improved scaling.

03:01.140 --> 03:06.360
It's going to be really impressive because all companies have these problems and they want people that

03:06.360 --> 03:08.550
can solve these type of problems.

03:09.070 --> 03:10.800
You have to be careful here.

03:10.930 --> 03:17.830
You can just make up stuff or say things that you cannot back up expect that once you answer this question

03:17.860 --> 03:21.090
the interviewer is going to ask you more details about it.

03:21.130 --> 03:28.270
So if you improved caching and the app to improve performance you better be sure that you're going to

03:28.270 --> 03:32.220
get asked how you did it in more detail so be able to answer those.

03:32.260 --> 03:35.660
But again with enough preparation this should be fairly easy to do.

03:36.880 --> 03:44.230
As a side note if this problem happened to be with maybe a teammate or your work team wasn't performing

03:44.230 --> 03:46.120
well don't be negative again.

03:46.270 --> 03:51.180
Never place blame on clients or coworkers or bosses.

03:51.370 --> 03:55.250
Just simply state the problem and say how you helped solved it.

03:55.270 --> 03:57.820
People don't really want to work with complainers.

03:57.820 --> 04:03.280
They want to work with people that just get to work solve problems and move on.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.300
Keep in mind don't be robotic when answering questions.

04:06.310 --> 04:13.530
Be human and a good way to think about this is if you saw yourself on TV answering this question will

04:13.600 --> 04:16.390
you like yourself and that's really it.

04:16.390 --> 04:22.220
So go out there have this question prepared because you're for sure going to get asked this question.

04:22.300 --> 04:25.530
I'll see in the next video ok I lied.

04:25.540 --> 04:30.810
There's one less thing and that is you're going to get a variation of this question such as.

04:30.810 --> 04:35.850
Tell me about an interesting project you've worked on and they're very similar.

04:35.850 --> 04:42.060
The goal here is to talk about an impressive project to wild the interviewer and tell them how a you're

04:42.060 --> 04:48.780
different because you're building these interesting things but also how you've worked with what the

04:48.780 --> 04:50.930
company is looking for in the past.

04:50.940 --> 04:57.010
So you've worked with javascript you've worked with C-Sharp you've worked with C++.

04:57.390 --> 05:00.620
Whenever you're talking about a project about a problem is solved.

05:00.720 --> 05:06.090
You always want to bring it back to what the company right now is looking for because at the end of

05:06.090 --> 05:07.900
the day that's what they care about they care about.

05:07.980 --> 05:10.020
Can you solve the problems.

05:10.090 --> 05:15.330
So again make sure you stand out and make sure you're related to the job.

05:15.430 --> 05:16.600
I'll see you in the next one.

05:16.900 --> 05:17.470
Bye bye.
