00:01.250 --> 00:09.430
Do you have any question for me or for us a question that always gets asked at the end of the interview.

00:09.620 --> 00:11.780
Once again we should be prepared.

00:11.780 --> 00:16.860
What should we ask the as always the key here is to stand out.

00:16.870 --> 00:22.000
You want to make sure that these questions demonstrate how you're really interested in the company and

00:22.000 --> 00:26.150
how you've thought well about why you want to work here.

00:27.230 --> 00:31.500
The key points here are to focus on the interviewer.

00:31.550 --> 00:34.200
So use the word you not.

00:35.720 --> 00:39.110
You can perhaps say you know I had a really good time at this interview.

00:39.320 --> 00:45.550
I do have a few questions for you and then direct that attention to that because interviewers are human

00:45.620 --> 00:51.650
too and as humans we like talking about ourself if throughout the entire interview all they did was

00:51.650 --> 00:54.960
ask questions and all you did was answer questions.

00:55.040 --> 01:01.250
They're probably bored out of their mind or at least not having as much time as if they were also got

01:01.250 --> 01:02.910
a chance to talk about themselves.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.460
So use that to your advantage.

01:05.350 --> 01:10.060
And ideally if you're able to mention something that they mentioned throughout the interview that also

01:10.060 --> 01:14.380
shows that you're paying attention and that you care which is a big bonus.

01:14.380 --> 01:20.470
Listen to what they say about themselves at the beginning or during the interview and bring it up later

01:20.470 --> 01:21.270
in the interview.

01:21.280 --> 01:27.880
Towards the end so that the question is tailored to them use their name and use what you know about

01:27.880 --> 01:32.660
them to ask a specific question What are some of these questions that you should ask.

01:32.680 --> 01:37.390
Here are a couple of questions that I personally would really like and I think are good questions to

01:37.390 --> 01:43.590
ask and you only need to ask maybe one two or three questions but you can pick your favorite.

01:43.690 --> 01:46.720
So here goes a couple of these one.

01:46.960 --> 01:53.410
What is the greatest mistake you made in the first month of the job and what did you do when you're

01:53.590 --> 01:56.780
interviewing them but this allows them to talk about themselves.

01:56.800 --> 02:04.150
The second one where do you see this company going in the next three years next five years.

02:05.130 --> 02:10.580
I want to be here for a while but you work here and have better knowledge of the company than I do.

02:10.590 --> 02:13.760
And I would like to see where the company is headed.

02:14.860 --> 02:20.510
A great question to show that you want to be here long term but you also get to find out about long

02:20.510 --> 02:22.780
term plans of the company.

02:22.790 --> 02:24.810
Why did you join this company.

02:24.980 --> 02:28.630
Again I asked them why they're here.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.480
Have you seen your skills girl in the past year.

02:32.450 --> 02:33.480
Another question.

02:34.350 --> 02:42.030
Is to perhaps ask them the one time that they messed up at the job and how it was handled by the company.

02:43.070 --> 02:50.200
And then finally my favorite question what they wish somebody told them when they just started the job

02:50.200 --> 02:51.620
at this company.

02:51.620 --> 02:56.300
That way they get to talk about their experience and that way you also get to find out how the first

02:56.300 --> 02:58.040
week of the job will be.

02:59.060 --> 03:05.180
Now all these questions are targeted towards the interviewer but it shows that you actually care and

03:05.180 --> 03:11.100
that you have genuine questions and you're not just here to land a job to make money.

03:11.270 --> 03:12.240
And that's it.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.140
Again it makes you more human and less of a robot.

03:16.160 --> 03:20.040
It's really going to create a better bond with your interviewer.

03:21.470 --> 03:23.010
I'll see you in the next video.

03:23.110 --> 03:23.720
Bye bye.
