All right we're on a roll here so let's just keep going through a few more questions here.

00:06.430 --> 00:09.270
What is your biggest weakness.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.670
How would you answer this.

00:11.020 --> 00:20.020
Well here's the thing with these questions you better not give something silly like I work too hard

00:20.380 --> 00:26.430
or my biggest weakness is that I care too much about my coworkers.

00:26.500 --> 00:33.810
First of all people can really see through that and label you as fake or a liar.

00:34.090 --> 00:40.510
But again every question should be something that makes you stand out that makes the age of your say

00:40.630 --> 00:42.100
wow I want to work with this person.

00:42.100 --> 00:47.740
So how can we twist this around to something that the interviewer is going to say yep this person should

00:47.740 --> 00:50.600
be hired for this company.

00:50.610 --> 00:51.650
It's very simple here.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.960
One is you need a real answer.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.830
Again no silly answers of how great you are.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.650
Be honest.

00:58.650 --> 01:02.790
Say something that you have as a real weakness.

01:02.940 --> 01:07.970
But the key is you have to show how you overcame it how you improved it.

01:08.160 --> 01:15.610
So don't say I'm too passionate maybe say something along the lines of sometimes when there's a problem

01:15.670 --> 01:19.210
I get straight into coding without really thinking about the problem.

01:19.420 --> 01:26.170
And as I'm typing I'm typing I realized that perhaps I should have waited planned out how I should write

01:26.170 --> 01:27.790
my code how it should be structured.

01:27.790 --> 01:32.170
What problem am I really solving before I start just coding it.

01:32.170 --> 01:39.340
So lately I've taken the time to make sure that I write pseudo code first just commenting out the steps

01:39.340 --> 01:46.510
that I want to take what my assumptions are well my inputs are and from there right out the steps that

01:46.510 --> 01:50.640
I want my code to take before I actually get into code you see what I did there.

01:50.710 --> 01:57.070
I talked about my weakness but somehow I turned it around to something that makes me a great candidate

01:57.370 --> 02:06.210
somebody that has improved from their past mistakes and now is working in a way that's ideal for a developer.

02:06.310 --> 02:06.880
That's it.

02:06.890 --> 02:08.020
There's not much to say here.

02:08.030 --> 02:14.300
Just be honest but use this question as a way to again show how you're better than the rest.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.360
How you're a great candidate.

02:16.460 --> 02:17.230
I'll see in the next one.
