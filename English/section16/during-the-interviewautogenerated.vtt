00:01.660 --> 00:08.100
Welcome back let's get into this section and the very first thing I want to talk about is mindset.

00:08.210 --> 00:15.260
You see the biggest mistake that we made going into an interview is that while thinking that this is

00:15.260 --> 00:24.670
your only chance the way you walk into an interview is to walk in knowing that you have many other opportunities.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.660
This is just one of them.

00:26.690 --> 00:30.010
It's not do or die it's not pass or fail.

00:30.080 --> 00:34.820
If this interview goes wrong and you don't get the job your life isn't over.

00:34.820 --> 00:41.190
So first and foremost treat everything as a learning experience.

00:41.750 --> 00:48.260
And what I mean by that is you go into the interview whether it's a phone interview or an onsite interview

00:48.950 --> 00:51.870
not expecting a job not hoping for a job.

00:51.950 --> 00:54.590
Don't hope for anything at all.

00:54.650 --> 00:58.310
Just go to learn to see where your weaknesses are.

00:58.490 --> 01:05.800
To learn about a company and as with anything as if you're running code to check how good your code

01:05.800 --> 01:09.650
is you just want to see how good you are at interviews.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.530
So that's the key.

01:12.180 --> 01:14.250
This is not your only chance.

01:14.370 --> 01:19.170
And if you go into that already you're going to be less nervous you're going to be more comfortable

01:19.170 --> 01:20.610
it's going to help you out a lot.

01:20.610 --> 01:25.220
I know it's silly I know it's one of those things that we all know but really do that.

01:25.290 --> 01:26.510
Don't go into an interview.

01:26.510 --> 01:30.760
Nervous and thinking that you know what if I don't get this then I'm not good enough.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.470
No this is just another practice another day at the office.

01:34.470 --> 01:37.890
You just trying to get to where you want to be next.

01:37.890 --> 01:44.100
Now what about when you actually go into the interview for the first time and this is where intervening

01:44.130 --> 01:46.930
is very similar to dating.

01:47.170 --> 01:54.210
Your interviewer is more likely to be excited about interviewing you if you're excited as well.

01:54.920 --> 02:00.320
Because sometimes interviewers are people from human resources that do this every single day.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.780
Or it could be other coders that are just taking time out of their day to interview.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.330
So you want to make this exciting and fun for them.

02:08.330 --> 02:13.480
It's not all about you it's also about them as well and they want to see if they want to work with you.

02:13.490 --> 02:18.940
This is a little trick that it sounds silly but it really really does work.

02:18.950 --> 02:24.540
Your goal is to enter the room with a lot of energy being happy excited to be there.

02:24.830 --> 02:30.350
And this is a classic psychological technique where humans when we interact with each other we match

02:30.380 --> 02:32.710
each other's energy and energy level.

02:32.840 --> 02:39.880
So if you're excited if you're you're walking in there with a big smile ready to get the interview going

02:40.370 --> 02:45.590
it's also going to jolt the interviewer to say All right let's do this let's have fun instead of just

02:45.680 --> 02:50.860
going they're nervous and scared because the interviewer is going to match your energy.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.430
So this is the trick.

02:52.490 --> 02:58.670
Before you open that door say to yourself I'm about to go meet a really good friend like you've known

02:58.670 --> 02:59.570
them for years.

02:59.660 --> 03:04.040
And by acting like that you're going to make the interviewer like you more.

03:04.130 --> 03:08.220
Again it sounds silly but it is a proven psychological technique.

03:08.300 --> 03:13.430
Not only that but excitement is a signal that you actually want this job.

03:13.460 --> 03:18.770
So again you're walking in about to meet a best friend and you're trying to make the interviewers day

03:19.010 --> 03:20.550
not bore them to death.

03:20.840 --> 03:25.820
And an interviewer wants to ask or answer three questions during this interview.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.300
The first one we know can you do the job.

03:29.330 --> 03:31.010
Do you have the coding skills necessary.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.360
Do you actually have the skills necessary.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.050
But this isn't the only question.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.320
You'll also have.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.690
Well can I work with you.

03:38.690 --> 03:43.750
Is this the type of person that I want to be coworkers with or are they going to be fun to be around.

03:43.940 --> 03:49.490
And this is a very important question that gets answered during this non-technical questions.

03:49.880 --> 03:53.980
And then the third one is are you going to improve.

03:54.160 --> 04:00.580
Because most of the times when you get hired as a developer you're not going to be 100 percent perfect

04:00.580 --> 04:06.760
match for them on your first day on your first week the first month you're learning on the job and learning

04:06.760 --> 04:11.580
their ways how their code bases work how their best practices works.

04:11.650 --> 04:16.810
And you're constantly improving and they're looking for people that can adapt quickly and learn.

04:16.810 --> 04:20.960
And a year from now become a really valuable asset.

04:20.980 --> 04:23.930
The first question can you do the job.

04:24.070 --> 04:27.220
We're prepared for that because we just finished a coding section.

04:27.220 --> 04:34.260
We know how to answer difficult technical questions but these other two we haven't really talked about

04:34.260 --> 04:34.460
them.

04:34.470 --> 04:36.670
And again that's where we're going to cover here.

04:36.690 --> 04:41.890
We're going to have the interviewer say yes to both of these last two questions.

04:41.910 --> 04:44.160
This is what we call behavioral question.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.190
Can I work with this person is this person going to be fun to work with.

04:47.280 --> 04:52.140
And are they the type of person that's constantly improving that's going to become better and better

04:52.740 --> 04:53.980
how do we do this.

04:54.790 --> 05:02.110
Well for the rest of the section I wanted to keep in mind these four figures what I call the four heroes

05:02.740 --> 05:07.660
and I know it's silly it's going to be a little cartoonish but this way hopefully you'll remember this

05:09.260 --> 05:15.770
you see before you enter the interview you have to have somewhere between two to four stories prepared

05:16.330 --> 05:22.610
that I called the four heroes and it has to demonstrate to the interviewer that you have these four

05:22.610 --> 05:24.750
hero qualities that they're looking for.

05:26.270 --> 05:33.990
The first one is technical you want to have a story prepared about your past experience maybe you worked

05:33.990 --> 05:39.780
on a really difficult project or a personal project that is going to impress the interviewer.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.550
A story just for yourself.

05:42.600 --> 05:49.320
You know a lot about because you've worked on it and something that shows the interviewer as soon as

05:49.320 --> 05:53.830
you tell the story that oh this person is really tactical and knows their stuff.

05:54.090 --> 05:56.880
So that's when we build that wanted to.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.950
Big project in our portfolio that we talked about at the beginning of the course.

06:00.990 --> 06:02.340
That's when this comes in.

06:02.340 --> 06:06.260
So you want to demonstrate that you're very technical and smart.

06:06.330 --> 06:13.320
That's the first year the second one success and this hero's story shows you that you're a successful

06:13.320 --> 06:17.050
person if you build something what did you do.

06:17.070 --> 06:23.430
Did you maybe start a little app that turned out to be quite successful and got a lot of users.

06:23.790 --> 06:28.540
Maybe your past job you got promoted to a senior level position.

06:28.680 --> 06:34.380
You want to have some sort of story that shows you that you're a successful person not a person that

06:34.380 --> 06:36.630
never succeeds in any job.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.790
The next one is leadership.

06:38.790 --> 06:44.310
Are you the type of person that takes charge doesn't get told what to do all the time and can be left

06:44.310 --> 06:45.070
on their own.

06:46.390 --> 06:49.420
Do you have leadership qualities.

06:49.650 --> 06:57.690
And then the last one is challenge and challenge is they want to hear a story of you going through some

06:57.900 --> 07:04.350
really challenging things maybe a challenging technical problem you had on a project and how you overcame

07:04.350 --> 07:09.510
it because you're a type of person that when presented with something that is really difficult that

07:09.510 --> 07:12.750
has no clear solution you can overcome it.

07:13.110 --> 07:16.180
When left alone you can overcome any challenge.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.740
And these four stories are going to be specific to you.

07:20.770 --> 07:27.040
So I can't really give you a story to tell the interviewer look in your past experiences and I guarantee

07:27.040 --> 07:33.140
you no matter what level of experience you have you'll have some stories from your past.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.490
It could be from work could be from projects.

07:35.500 --> 07:43.140
It could be from other things where you're able to demonstrate these four heroes the rest of this section.

07:43.150 --> 07:48.250
The answer is we're going to give Well we're going to talk about are all going to demonstrate these

07:48.250 --> 07:50.010
four heroes.

07:50.020 --> 07:54.650
We're not going to say to the interviewer Oh I'm a very successful person because I did this.

07:54.670 --> 07:54.980
No.

07:55.030 --> 08:00.760
We're going to tell the stories that we have to remember remember two to four stories that demonstrate

08:00.760 --> 08:06.970
these hero values and we're going to tell these stories and the interviewer is going to get that.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.930
We have these four qualities these four heroes just through the stories.

08:13.180 --> 08:19.600
And if you have these stories prepared before they interview well then you can always depending on what

08:19.600 --> 08:20.580
question you get asked.

08:20.590 --> 08:27.460
You can always answer these questions with some sort of these stories that you have because these stories

08:27.460 --> 08:28.890
are already prepared for you.

08:28.900 --> 08:34.780
This is where I say that all non-technical interviews sound the same because you have these stories

08:34.780 --> 08:39.570
prepared and you just change them up a bit to answer the specific question.

08:39.580 --> 08:44.170
But deep down inside you're just demonstrating these qualities.

08:44.230 --> 08:50.200
Remember these qualities are the qualities that we have to answer the last two questions.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.470
And that is can I work with this person.

08:52.570 --> 08:55.320
And are you going to improve.

08:55.400 --> 09:01.080
So let's get into it and answer some questions that we might get asked in an interview.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.540
I'll see in the next one.

09:02.540 --> 09:03.160
Bye bye.
