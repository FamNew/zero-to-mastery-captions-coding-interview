00:02.020 --> 00:09.940
You just finish the interview it's whole over all that preparation all the work that went into it finally

00:09.940 --> 00:10.450
done.

00:10.450 --> 00:13.450
These are the final seconds of the interview.

00:13.630 --> 00:14.590
What do you do.

00:14.590 --> 00:21.670
Well first off you want to think you're a recruiter or they INTERVIEWER And you want to sound excited

00:21.910 --> 00:26.800
you know hopefully this won't be hard you're actually excited about the job but you made a good first

00:26.800 --> 00:28.460
impression when you walked into the door.

00:28.570 --> 00:35.890
And you also want to and on a good impression at the end to be very positive the area energetic and

00:35.920 --> 00:42.250
thank them for their time if you're able to you can also ask for specific feedback on your interview

00:42.310 --> 00:43.090
performance.

00:43.090 --> 00:47.060
Usually they won't say but that never is to ask either.

00:47.170 --> 00:53.200
And you also want to ask them when you should expect to hear back from them so that you have some sort

00:53.200 --> 00:59.920
of a timeline of when the decision is going to be made whether to give you the job or to do another

00:59.920 --> 01:00.590
interview.

01:00.910 --> 01:05.490
Now at the end of the interview I like to prepare something called a closing statement.

01:05.500 --> 01:10.000
Most people get intimidated by interviews and especially technical ones.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.640
However the first and last impressions are what most interviewers remember.

01:15.760 --> 01:21.310
So at the end of the interview no matter how well the interview has gone whether you think you're not

01:21.310 --> 01:24.310
going to get the job or whether you wasted.

01:24.310 --> 01:30.820
You want to conclude with something that touches on all of these points that is you want to make a statement

01:30.820 --> 01:32.800
that doesn't use the word I.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.170
So you don't keep talking about yourself.

01:35.230 --> 01:37.020
You want to talk about the interviewer.

01:37.240 --> 01:41.790
You want to express how you're the ideal candidate the best candidate for the job.

01:42.070 --> 01:45.310
But doing so without bragging.

01:45.420 --> 01:46.760
So what does that mean.

01:46.920 --> 01:53.640
Here's an example of what I would say if it was the end of the interview and I want to essentially end

01:53.640 --> 01:56.660
off the interview on a good note thank you for your time.

01:56.670 --> 02:01.040
I'm sure you have lots of candidates to see but I want to say one last thing.

02:01.170 --> 02:04.700
There are no shortages of developers for you to interview.

02:05.010 --> 02:11.120
However there is a shortage of good talented ego less developers with ambition to learn.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.700
It's not the ones that are unable to admit that they are wrong.

02:14.820 --> 02:21.530
The best developers aren't the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders.

02:21.570 --> 02:24.550
It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong.

02:25.200 --> 02:31.310
I am not the most experienced developer that you may interview today but the one thing that you can

02:31.310 --> 02:37.190
guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his or her

02:37.190 --> 02:38.580
skill every day.

02:38.780 --> 02:44.870
Play nicely with all the other developers that the company isn't so narrow minded and problem solving

02:45.200 --> 02:49.530
that he or she isn't willing to try new and novel ideas.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.450
When you hire me you will rest assured that you won't have to micromanage me.

02:53.450 --> 02:56.460
You don't have to extinguish fires.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.080
And in one year I'll be one of your most valuable employees.

03:00.290 --> 03:05.510
I can guarantee you that I'm at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I

03:05.510 --> 03:08.510
can grow with and be surrounded by smart people like yourself.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.420
And I've chosen this company specific for that reason.

03:11.540 --> 03:16.940
And you've probably had similar experiences in your career where one company allows you to really have

03:17.210 --> 03:18.950
an impact and propel your career.

03:19.070 --> 03:22.560
I'm at this stage now and I hope to be part of the team with you.

03:22.580 --> 03:26.950
So thank you for your time and I hope to hear back soon from you.

03:26.990 --> 03:27.690
All right.

03:27.730 --> 03:28.360
Has it.

03:28.430 --> 03:37.610
Now this may sound a little intense but who would you hire a developer that did pretty well at an interview

03:37.640 --> 03:44.870
and blends in well with all the other interviews that the interviewer has done or the developer who

03:44.870 --> 03:50.000
wanted it more than any others and really showed how much they want the job.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.030
Again this depends on your personality.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.720
But the idea is that you want to finish the interview strong.

03:55.970 --> 04:00.710
And after the interview you want to write perhaps an email afterwards to the people that interviewed

04:00.710 --> 04:01.010
you.

04:01.010 --> 04:06.340
You can thank them if during the interview there are technical challenges that you weren't able to answer.

04:06.350 --> 04:12.170
You can actually reply to them that you have looked at the problem and you have now find a solution.

04:12.200 --> 04:17.330
And there's something that you can probably do easily by googling but this shows that even if you didn't

04:17.450 --> 04:23.210
solve the specific problem that they had you have take the time to actually solve it now.

04:23.630 --> 04:26.660
And in this thank you email you just don't want to sound like a robot.

04:26.870 --> 04:27.840
Just nice and short.

04:27.980 --> 04:32.630
Thank them for the time show that you're interested in the position and that you look forward to the

04:32.630 --> 04:33.850
next step.

04:33.950 --> 04:40.310
Now if for some reason you haven't heard back by the time the deadline has passed just message him again

04:40.370 --> 04:45.860
and let them know that you're waiting for a reply and we'll need to make a decision soon since you're

04:45.860 --> 04:51.380
interviewing at other companies but wanted to make sure that you don't make a decision without knowing

04:51.380 --> 04:56.390
the situation at this company since you really enjoyed the interview process here.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.740
And this is a bit of a psychological technique that we're going to talk about that in the negotiation

05:00.770 --> 05:04.390
and offer section but that's a nice thing to say.

05:04.390 --> 05:10.490
In case you're just waiting around for an offer because remember the more time you wait the more people

05:10.650 --> 05:11.830
they're going to interview you.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.080
So think about that.

05:13.290 --> 05:16.430
All right now it's just a waiting game.

05:16.460 --> 05:20.020
Good job on the interview and hopefully everything went well.

05:21.350 --> 05:22.860
I'll see you in the next one.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.210
Buh-Bye.
