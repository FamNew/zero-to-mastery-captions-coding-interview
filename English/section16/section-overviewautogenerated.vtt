00:01.320 --> 00:09.870
Hello and welcome back if you've gotten through the intense coding section where we learned about data

00:09.870 --> 00:11.820
structures and algorithms.

00:11.820 --> 00:13.430
Well good job.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.220
The good news is that the hard part is over.

00:17.220 --> 00:25.110
The bad news is that well you're not going to get any job you want because coding is just part of a

00:25.110 --> 00:32.670
job interview and as you know you have the technical side and also the non technical questions and depending

00:32.670 --> 00:36.360
on who you are you might find one easier than the other.

00:36.360 --> 00:42.720
And when we say non technical questions those are the questions asked in an interview by the interviewer

00:43.080 --> 00:48.660
to see whether they want to work with you whether you'd be a good fit in the company and to make sure

00:48.660 --> 00:55.080
that you're not only just good at coding because you have to be good at working well with others in

00:55.080 --> 00:57.990
this section we're going to tackle this problem.

00:58.050 --> 01:06.010
How do we succeed in a non technical interview when we get asked what we call behavioral questions.

01:06.030 --> 01:09.850
Let's have a look at where we're going to talk about in this section.

01:09.870 --> 01:14.100
We're going to talk about what we're going to do during the interview and we're going to create an overall

01:14.100 --> 01:19.910
strategy so that we're as successful as possible just like we did with the technical part.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.990
We're going to talk about specific questions in how to answer them.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.300
And the good news is that most of these questions are the same.

01:26.310 --> 01:32.160
They may sound different and different companies and they might tweak it a little bit but the overall

01:32.160 --> 01:34.260
answers are pretty much the same.

01:34.260 --> 01:40.620
So once you've gone through a couple of them it actually becomes easier and easier and all these questions

01:40.620 --> 01:42.900
can just be given with the same answer.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.780
So all your non-technical interviews pretty much sound the same.

01:46.860 --> 01:52.950
So let's just perfect that we're going to talk about how to answer questions like tell me about a problem

01:52.950 --> 01:53.810
solved.

01:53.850 --> 01:55.240
Why do you want to work for us.

01:56.050 --> 01:59.350
What kind of questions to ask the interviewer at the end of the interview.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.400
The question that we always get asked at the beginning of the interview which is tell me about yourself

02:04.440 --> 02:06.010
how do we answer that.

02:06.010 --> 02:08.050
What is our biggest weakness.

02:08.090 --> 02:13.730
And then we're also going to talk about what to do after the interview to maximize our success and also

02:13.730 --> 02:19.280
a little fun seeker what section where I'm going and talk about some of the things that we can use to

02:19.370 --> 02:21.440
impress the interviewer.

02:21.470 --> 02:23.270
It's going to be a fun section.

02:23.270 --> 02:24.910
We're going to take a break from coding.

02:24.950 --> 02:30.870
So if your brain is a bit of a mush after the coding section Well you can just take it easy.

02:30.890 --> 02:34.920
Sit on the couch press play and hopefully I don't bore you too much.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.560
So I'll see you in the next video.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.090
Bye bye.
