Hello there I want to talk quickly about one of the tools that we're going to use throughout the course

00:07.690 --> 00:13.780
especially when we do bone ask questions and also for you to use after you're done with a course in

00:13.780 --> 00:14.410
my opinion.

00:14.410 --> 00:18.560
This is the best website to get interview questions.

00:18.710 --> 00:25.270
And the thing that I love about Leatt code is that they have a ton of questions but they give really

00:25.270 --> 00:32.830
really good descriptions and you're also able to code online in a ton of different languages that you

00:32.830 --> 00:33.750
choose.

00:33.790 --> 00:42.170
It's up to you why you choose to code in and although they have a paid version you can do most of these

00:42.170 --> 00:45.890
problems without a subscription just for free.

00:45.890 --> 00:51.170
I also want to give you a heads up and let you know that their interface sometimes changes as you can

00:51.170 --> 00:52.290
see for some problems.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.610
It looks like this.

00:53.810 --> 00:59.360
And when you watch this video things might be organized a little bit different on the screen but the

00:59.360 --> 01:04.410
key thing is there is this solution tap which some questions will have.

01:05.700 --> 01:12.300
But my favorite is The discuss that because no matter what your language you can type in a solution

01:12.300 --> 01:15.820
here and you'll see all the people that did their solution.

01:15.900 --> 01:24.540
And let's say Python or let's say you want to do C++ Well all the C++ solutions are here as well as

01:24.540 --> 01:27.730
the votes views and comments.

01:27.740 --> 01:30.600
This is again one of my favorite resources.

01:30.770 --> 01:37.010
But I want to warn you there are a ton of problems here and they vary from easy to really difficult

01:37.340 --> 01:41.950
and you can spend a lot of time just constantly doing these questions over and over.

01:42.200 --> 01:47.890
But don't get sucked into the rabbit hole after you do a certain number of problems here.

01:47.990 --> 01:52.560
You're already going to be a lot better than the average programmer.

01:52.730 --> 01:58.970
So do them for fun afterwards but don't forget to focus on what the most important task at hand is that

01:58.970 --> 02:01.040
is getting that dream job.

02:01.580 --> 02:07.850
And don't worry some of the top programmers still have difficulties with some of the questions here.

02:07.850 --> 02:15.080
So never feel like this shows you the quality of the program or you are it's just a playground for you

02:15.080 --> 02:18.220
to use throughout your career to improve.

02:18.410 --> 02:21.750
And no they are not sponsoring me or doing anything like that.

02:21.890 --> 02:23.930
I just think they are a great tool.

02:24.910 --> 02:26.900
I'll see in the next one away.
