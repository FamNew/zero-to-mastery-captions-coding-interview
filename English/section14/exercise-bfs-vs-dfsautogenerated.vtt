Welcome back.

00:01.710 --> 00:08.910
Let's do a little exercise with just the general information we have about these two traversal techniques.

00:08.940 --> 00:10.560
I have questions here for you.

00:10.570 --> 00:17.930
And underneath it I want you to answer whether you should use breadth first search or depth first search.

00:18.270 --> 00:22.980
And these are the type of questions that you're going to get asked in an interview.

00:23.070 --> 00:24.780
And it's good to understand.

00:25.170 --> 00:29.230
I know that our knowledge is incomplete yet because we haven't coded anything.

00:29.430 --> 00:35.850
But I want to lay the foundation is that when we start coding you understand why we have these things.

00:35.850 --> 00:42.830
So give it a go try and answer these questions and in the next video I'll go over the solutions.

00:43.120 --> 00:43.410
Buh-Bye.
