We've talked about recursion and sorting we have a few more to go.

00:07.560 --> 00:14.970
And in this section we're going to talk about searching and traversal including breadth first search

00:15.180 --> 00:21.380
and depth first search searching is something we do a lot on our computers.

00:21.380 --> 00:27.320
When we talked about sorting some of you may have been like man it doesn't really sound that useful

00:28.040 --> 00:29.320
but searching.

00:29.540 --> 00:32.210
We use that every day don't we.

00:32.210 --> 00:34.590
We look for files on our computer.

00:34.970 --> 00:44.030
WE RUN command af and search for things search for words and documents we search Google we search youtube

00:44.630 --> 00:51.220
we search hashtags on Twitter and Instagram searching is a big part of our lives.

00:51.350 --> 00:56.660
But how are all these computers and programs able to search things so fast.

00:57.660 --> 01:03.060
There's more and more data in this world more and more Web sites to search for.

01:03.060 --> 01:06.180
How are we able to do these things so fast.

01:06.180 --> 01:09.310
How is Google able to do these things so fast.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.130
Well in this section we're going to build this foundation of how it all works.

01:15.470 --> 01:21.110
And we're going to be talking about a few types of searching and traversal and hopefully by the end

01:21.110 --> 01:27.670
of it all you're going to understand how places like Facebook Google and Google Maps work.

01:28.010 --> 01:33.000
When it comes to searching at a fundamental level let's get started.
