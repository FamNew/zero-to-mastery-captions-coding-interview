00:01.240 --> 00:03.200
Hello to.

00:03.260 --> 00:03.680
All right.

00:03.710 --> 00:04.610
I'm very excited.

00:04.610 --> 00:12.680
The very first section of the Course now in order to get any job you need to have interviews in order

00:12.680 --> 00:18.680
to get any interviews you need to actually apply and get these interviews.

00:19.360 --> 00:27.460
If you're the best interviewer the best at answering questions solving puzzles the best coder you won't

00:27.460 --> 00:33.530
really mean much if you're unable to get an interview at a company and get them to see you.

00:34.350 --> 00:39.090
So the first step is also this getting the actual interview.

00:40.010 --> 00:44.330
Now the number one thing we need to do is to increase these odds.

00:44.450 --> 00:51.720
The odds of getting an interview the more interviews you get the more likely to get a job.

00:51.770 --> 00:58.190
The best way to get a job on top of being a good interviewer is getting in the door as much as possible

00:58.340 --> 01:00.180
and practicing your interviews.

01:01.280 --> 01:06.710
We are starting this course with this first step so that even just a few minutes into the course you

01:06.710 --> 01:08.640
can start applying to jobs.

01:08.660 --> 01:14.450
In practice your interviewing skills as most companies won't get back to you right away.

01:14.780 --> 01:21.000
So while you go through the course you can start applying to companies and wait to hear back from them.

01:22.270 --> 01:26.580
And while you're waiting you can practice your actual interviewing skills.

01:26.770 --> 01:30.400
So by the time that the interview comes you're going to be ready for it.

01:31.520 --> 01:37.910
So let's have this goal in mind if I applied to 100 companies how can I increase the number of companies

01:37.910 --> 01:40.960
that will get back to me with interviews.

01:41.020 --> 01:48.270
We want to increase this percentage by the end of this section I want your success rate to be higher

01:48.300 --> 01:53.370
than 1 percent 5 percent maybe maybe higher.

01:53.370 --> 01:58.590
It doesn't matter as long as we're able to increase this by increasing your percentage.

01:58.770 --> 02:05.620
You're getting closer and closer to that dream job if you're applying to 100 jobs and you're not hearing

02:05.620 --> 02:13.120
back from any of them or you only get one interview that's 1 percent then you're probably doing something

02:13.120 --> 02:13.840
wrong.

02:13.900 --> 02:18.370
So we're going to take a look at that and make sure that you're following best practice and you're also

02:18.370 --> 02:23.660
doing a couple of tricks to make sure that your success rate isn't necessarily 1 percent.

02:23.680 --> 02:28.920
However there is some good news for you interviewing is a numbers game.

02:29.210 --> 02:36.290
A person who has failed a hundred interviews and got rejected by God 1 acceptance of Google is just

02:36.290 --> 02:43.070
the same as a person that has never failed an interview and is now working at Google with you despite

02:43.070 --> 02:49.040
them having offers from all the other companies never failing an interview always basing their coding

02:49.040 --> 02:50.120
interviews.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.930
That doesn't really matter at the end of the day.

02:52.940 --> 02:58.860
All you need is that one really good offer and you are in the same boat as somebody else.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.160
How awesome is that in your resume.

03:01.160 --> 03:07.390
You don't put down how many times you failed your resume looks the same as I sign over there.

03:07.400 --> 03:11.770
Well maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration but I hope you get this point.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.770
Your resume looks the same as a person who never got rejected at an interview.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.340
That's the good news.

03:17.410 --> 03:23.420
And as a matter of fact I know a person who has been rejected by Google multiple times but kept applying

03:23.750 --> 03:25.820
and is now working at Google.

03:26.210 --> 03:31.990
So in the upcoming section we're going to be talking about some of these topics and it should not take

03:31.990 --> 03:36.130
you more than a week to set everything up and start applying to jobs.

03:36.130 --> 03:41.350
If you're spending more than that then you're wasting your time when you can be doing something better

03:41.350 --> 03:44.710
such as improving your actual skills as a programmer.

03:46.130 --> 03:46.930
Don't get me wrong.

03:47.030 --> 03:53.720
You can keep improving here and there to optimize things but the overall effort you put in to set things

03:53.720 --> 03:58.210
up before you start applying should be less than a week.

03:58.220 --> 04:02.960
Most people spend too much time editing their resume and never applying to jobs.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.930
But we're not going to do that.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.240
So we're going to be covering how to optimize your resume.

04:08.380 --> 04:11.720
LinkedIn profiles your portfolio.

04:11.980 --> 04:15.610
How to use e-mail and referral to your advantage.

04:15.640 --> 04:20.820
And we're also going to cover some common questions such as how to make up for lack of experience.

04:20.860 --> 04:25.960
Maybe you've just recently learned how to program and you don't have any job experience.

04:26.170 --> 04:27.500
How do we overcome them.

04:28.600 --> 04:34.000
We're also going to talk about when should you start applying to jobs when are you truly ready because

04:34.210 --> 04:39.610
some jobs posts that they need five years of experience and you're not sure whether you should apply

04:39.610 --> 04:40.540
to them or not.

04:40.720 --> 04:47.170
And finally we're also going to talk about where to find the jobs and what are some of the best places

04:47.320 --> 04:49.580
to look for jobs and apply online.

04:50.900 --> 04:56.240
And last note here I want to warn you some of these topics may be obvious to you.

04:56.300 --> 05:02.030
I've included them on here because not everyone will know these things although some things may seem

05:02.120 --> 05:03.820
obvious and silly.

05:03.830 --> 05:09.100
The last thing I want to do is to just assume that this comes easy and natural to you.

05:09.200 --> 05:15.100
Keep in mind that educational background cultures and many other factors will come into play here.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.200
So keep that in mind.

05:17.260 --> 05:24.710
The more technical fun part and frankly my favorite parts are going to start to begin after this section.

05:25.580 --> 05:29.900
So you're more than welcome to skip the section if you feel that getting an interview is not an issue

05:29.900 --> 05:33.760
for you but otherwise you might learn a thing or two.

05:33.820 --> 05:37.650
So stick with me and I'll see you in the next video.

05:37.750 --> 05:38.020
Buh-Bye.
