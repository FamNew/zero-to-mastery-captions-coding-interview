00:00.820 --> 00:03.320
You were down with the section.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.690
Now let's review what we've learned.

00:05.800 --> 00:11.290
And before I do that I'm going to tell you something that is counter intuitive don't reply to a thousand

00:11.290 --> 00:15.180
positions online just sending out your resume everywhere.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.270
That's what most people do.

00:17.560 --> 00:24.710
Instead pick five to 10 companies you want to work for and fully target and focus on applying to them.

00:25.850 --> 00:31.820
You see that is the main goal that we started with increase our chances of getting an interview.

00:31.850 --> 00:38.520
All of our actions create that and a week's worth of work will set us up for future success.

00:38.630 --> 00:43.310
Setting up something like a good resume Linked-In profile.

00:43.460 --> 00:47.050
We keep our options open as people contact us.

00:47.060 --> 00:53.450
Like I said at the beginning of this section most of this should take you a week to set up as you go

00:53.450 --> 00:55.200
on and you may get feedback.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.930
You can keep updating things.

00:57.080 --> 01:03.360
The only thing that may take you longer is perhaps one to two day projects for your portfolio.

01:03.680 --> 01:09.320
But that is a good investment because not only are you learning how to build things but it will give

01:09.320 --> 01:14.360
you things to talk about in the interview and you are actually coding instead of just typing up a resume

01:14.360 --> 01:18.880
that doesn't really help you as a developer or an engineer.

01:20.230 --> 01:25.750
We talked about email and contacting people directly and getting referrals as a better way to A-plot

01:26.110 --> 01:28.620
than being completely anonymous.

01:28.630 --> 01:34.200
We talked about how to overcome the lack of experience when you're ready to apply.

01:34.390 --> 01:41.010
The short answer was now and where you can find jobs and the most efficient way to apply.

01:41.140 --> 01:45.510
If you've noticed the focus is on quality over quantity.

01:45.730 --> 01:51.810
Even though I said it's a numbers game your time is better invested in focusing your approach.

01:51.890 --> 01:52.320
All right.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.050
All right that's enough.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.030
I apologize for this section.

01:56.030 --> 01:58.540
I know it's not the most exciting section.

01:58.550 --> 02:06.590
It's really hard to make resumes exciting as a topic but we're going to get to the actual fine coding

02:06.590 --> 02:08.090
technical bar now.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.620
So thanks for sticking with me.

02:10.670 --> 02:15.020
It's going to get a lot more fun and I'll see you in the next section.
