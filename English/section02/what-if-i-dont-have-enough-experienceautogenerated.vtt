00:00.790 --> 00:08.610
What do I do if I don't have enough experience what if I'm underqualified for a job well first of all

00:08.940 --> 00:14.370
you should have this mentality in mind when applying to jobs and apply to jobs that you feel you are

00:14.430 --> 00:22.170
under qualified for if a job is asking you to do something that you already feel confident then you

00:22.170 --> 00:26.020
should ask yourself What am I going to learn in this job.

00:26.340 --> 00:31.650
Am I going to learn actually is this job going to put things on my resume that will make me get better

00:31.890 --> 00:34.890
and get a better position in the future.

00:34.890 --> 00:39.940
Or am I just going to do the same thing that I already know what to do or how to do it.

00:39.960 --> 00:47.190
Finally you have to keep in mind that job postings are put in order to weed out the weak candidates.

00:47.250 --> 00:54.180
I have seen way too many of these created by non-technical people or just making job sound tougher than

00:54.180 --> 00:58.830
it really is to remove junior developers or engineers from applying.

00:59.160 --> 01:03.160
So ask yourself Is this job going to be tough.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.590
Good then.

01:04.770 --> 01:09.100
That is why you want that's why you should be doing.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.440
Do you feel competent.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.940
You are very qualified for this job.

01:13.350 --> 01:18.410
OK then maybe you should push yourself and apply to a job that's more difficult than you think.

01:18.450 --> 01:23.790
Every application should be a long shot if you're applying to something that you're 100 percent qualified

01:23.790 --> 01:24.650
for.

01:24.690 --> 01:26.220
Where is your room to grow.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.890
So dream big.

01:28.170 --> 01:32.860
But in order to dream big you might have a bit of a roadblock.

01:32.940 --> 01:36.750
What if you don't have enough experience.

01:36.890 --> 01:40.540
I don't love resumes and I don't think a lot of people do either.

01:40.710 --> 01:46.050
But sometimes without a resume you cannot get an interview in order to have a good resume.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.990
You need to have something to put on it like great experience.

01:51.010 --> 01:55.870
Here's the cash so how can you have good experience if you're just getting started.

01:55.900 --> 02:00.640
It's like you have no hope if you're a beginner or if you don't have enough work experience because

02:00.640 --> 02:03.760
you're just out of school or you're changing careers.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.240
Well not quite as with everything.

02:06.230 --> 02:08.020
There's the regular way of doing things.

02:08.020 --> 02:15.150
Then there's the smart way you see experience doesn't come just from working at another company.

02:15.150 --> 02:19.430
There are many ways that you can demonstrate experience without a past job.

02:19.590 --> 02:23.050
And here you'll find my favorite ways to show improve.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.930
You can get the job done.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.960
You will have to do every single one of them.

02:26.970 --> 02:29.580
But two out of four of these are even better.

02:29.580 --> 02:35.990
Three out of four will be great at showcasing on your resume and make you stand up.

02:36.420 --> 02:39.820
So let's go in order and see how we can do this.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.010
The first one is get help.

02:43.450 --> 02:49.300
Get help is a great way to demonstrate that you actually code that you've built projects.

02:49.330 --> 02:56.620
The number one thing you can do is to start making comments and making sure that you have a good history

02:56.890 --> 02:58.460
of things that you've done.

02:58.630 --> 03:03.250
And by the way if you're wondering how I got this cat picture in here I'll show you a little trick in

03:03.250 --> 03:09.990
the next exercise to make your contribution look a little bit nicer and busier.

03:09.990 --> 03:17.940
In case you're just getting started and you don't have a good past history another way to improve your

03:18.120 --> 03:25.990
get high profile or to just add more experience is contributing and participating in open source projects.

03:26.010 --> 03:34.950
For example I've created a zero to mastery organization where we have a Hohn of open source projects

03:34.950 --> 03:43.310
by the community that you can contribute to and they're made specifically for you to mess up make mistakes.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.490
Nobody is going to yell you.

03:44.490 --> 03:49.980
These are just fun projects that are open source they can contribute to and you can do as much or as

03:49.980 --> 03:55.860
little as you want but this will improve your experience and contributing to open source projects and

03:55.850 --> 04:01.270
it's something you can add to your resumes now contributing to open source project.

04:01.290 --> 04:07.830
Recruiters love seeing this because this demonstrates that you can work with others and also with something

04:07.830 --> 04:10.110
like get hub and version control.

04:10.170 --> 04:11.560
All right let's look at the next one.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.940
The next salon is Web site.

04:15.060 --> 04:20.490
If you are especially a full stack or FRONT-END DEVELOPER or even a designer you should have your own

04:20.620 --> 04:23.850
website where you can showcase your skills.

04:23.900 --> 04:29.900
Again is something you can speak about in your interview and about how you built the website or it gives

04:29.900 --> 04:32.980
you a good way to talk about your past projects.

04:32.990 --> 04:38.090
Now you're asking yourself what Andre am I going to have to build a whole new website and waste a bunch

04:38.090 --> 04:38.650
of time.

04:38.660 --> 04:39.680
Well not really.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.910
Let me show you a couple of tricks you see you don't need to build your own website from scratch.

04:44.960 --> 04:51.050
There's a ton of free templates like creative time here that just gives you a nice template for you

04:51.050 --> 04:58.010
to use and fill in with your information we can also look at this one.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.130
And again free templates that you can use.

05:00.140 --> 05:05.610
I especially like the mountain template and you can see that yeah.

05:05.720 --> 05:11.510
I mean you can customize this to your own and make it look professional and it's already designed nicely

05:11.540 --> 05:21.900
and also customized for different experiences such as mobile tablet and in a day you can have your own

05:22.330 --> 05:23.450
website.

05:23.620 --> 05:28.680
And just to show you how you shouldn't really spend too much time on your own web site.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.390
One of my favorite people to follow is Kevin Kelly.

05:32.420 --> 05:38.780
He is very very popular among the tech community and just overall really smart thinker.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.860
And you can see his Web site over here.

05:41.870 --> 05:43.550
It's very simple.

05:43.700 --> 05:44.860
Nothing exaggerated.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.670
A very very clean but small very basic layout.

05:50.270 --> 05:54.430
And this is to show you that you don't need some crazy animations.

05:54.470 --> 05:58.940
Make it all flashy to stand out as long as you have a personal website.

05:58.940 --> 06:04.760
It just shows that you actually spend time building it and doing something that most people wouldn't

06:04.760 --> 06:05.190
do.

06:06.200 --> 06:12.610
Another thing that I want to show you is for example the job or that we have for all of my students

06:12.800 --> 06:16.680
and this is again another Oberth sourced project that the community built.

06:16.850 --> 06:24.200
If we just search through let's say Toronto developers here and we go to Christine a key I hope I'm

06:24.200 --> 06:25.280
saying glossing right.

06:25.340 --> 06:28.790
You can see how simple yet beautiful her portfolio is.

06:28.820 --> 06:36.110
If we go to about me just a nice little bio with links to her profile we go to projects we see some

06:36.110 --> 06:37.220
of their projects.

06:37.460 --> 06:43.650
And this is something that she can put on her resume and immediately stand out from the crowd.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.910
And it also gives her an opportunity to list projects that she can talk about when she gets to an interview.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.590
All right let's look at the next topic.

06:52.730 --> 06:56.520
One two two big projects now.

06:56.870 --> 07:04.270
You can't really fake experience if you've never built anything beyond a to do list or a Hello World

07:04.270 --> 07:04.800
app.

07:04.970 --> 07:08.300
You simply will not be able to get very good jobs.

07:08.360 --> 07:13.730
However most people think having a hundred projects is the way to go.

07:13.820 --> 07:21.350
So they do a project today and build small projects many small tiny projects to have 30 of them and

07:21.350 --> 07:25.490
they start building all these projects that are very very simple.

07:26.170 --> 07:28.270
Now that's not actually impressive.

07:28.270 --> 07:31.680
I mean it shows that you're working hard and coding along.

07:31.750 --> 07:39.010
But if I'm a recruiter you can show me a project of maybe tic tac toe but I don't really care that's

07:39.010 --> 07:43.740
something that anybody can build with a bit of coding experience in a day or two.

07:43.780 --> 07:49.860
Frankly no recruiter or interviewer is going to check out all your 30 projects most of the time.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.710
We want to hear your most difficult or the hardest.

07:53.710 --> 07:58.850
Biggest project you've worked on instead of spending your time on these small little projects.

07:58.990 --> 08:06.720
Spend your time on one or two big projects for example and other courses that I teach.

08:06.730 --> 08:13.250
We built a face recognition app and this app well has a front end.

08:13.300 --> 08:21.570
Using reactionless a backend where we have a restful API server with Express We've deployed to Iraq

08:22.170 --> 08:32.010
we've created session management with authenticator routes we store user information such as username

08:32.250 --> 08:37.020
and also hashed passwords securely in our database on postscripts.

08:37.020 --> 08:46.180
We've deployed our app with docker and we've also used a rattus for session management and caching.

08:46.200 --> 08:53.310
Now all of that may not mean a lot to you but having something like a one big project they can talk

08:53.310 --> 08:59.370
about all these things will make you sound a lot more impressive than somebody that just built a ton

08:59.370 --> 09:06.490
of tiny projects so focus on that have wanted to big projects that you can show off makes you stand

09:06.490 --> 09:06.860
out.

09:06.910 --> 09:12.340
And it's also going to give you something to talk about during the interview and put it up on your website

09:12.370 --> 09:19.510
or create its own Web site and you immediately can put this as the first item on your resume because

09:19.630 --> 09:23.680
here's the thing if you don't have work experience.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.030
If you go back to the resume we used then the exercise.

09:27.190 --> 09:28.590
Remember this resume.

09:28.840 --> 09:36.620
Well if you have no work experience maybe for work experience you can say something like javascript

09:36.620 --> 09:42.840
developer or web application developer and talk about how you build your project here.

09:44.090 --> 09:50.060
Because to a recruiter it doesn't really matter if you worked at a certain company building an application

09:50.090 --> 09:53.540
or on your own or that could be a little bit Vic too.

09:53.540 --> 09:54.790
They don't need to know that.

09:54.920 --> 10:01.610
They just need to know that you build things that are real that are big and complicated and you solved

10:01.610 --> 10:02.930
hard problems.

10:02.930 --> 10:11.210
So having one or two big projects they you can list on your experiences is a great way to add to your

10:11.210 --> 10:16.350
resume if you don't have enough past work experience at companies.

10:16.540 --> 10:22.780
And I have a few students who have actually used this technique to get interviews even though they just

10:22.780 --> 10:23.820
learn how to code.

10:23.860 --> 10:31.150
Six months ago and then finally we have the blog posts or block.

10:31.150 --> 10:33.760
Let's have a look at what I mean by that.

10:33.780 --> 10:39.480
This is another thing you can include in your resume especially if it's related to a technology you're

10:39.480 --> 10:41.410
using or the company is using.

10:42.330 --> 10:50.550
For example I have here my medium profile a medium dotcom allows anybody around the world to just post

10:51.240 --> 10:57.810
a blog post and it's very popular with the tech community so there's a lot of tech related posts that

10:57.820 --> 11:00.610
you right on medium and there's other platforms like this.

11:00.690 --> 11:07.350
What if you wrote a blog post about a specific technology that the company you're applying for is using

11:08.440 --> 11:14.560
or some sort of a technical problem that they're facing by doing that and just adding a link to that

11:14.560 --> 11:15.400
block post.

11:15.530 --> 11:18.750
It gives you again another leg up to most people.

11:19.720 --> 11:26.350
And the great thing about platforms like this is that well if we go to one of my articles here you can

11:26.560 --> 11:31.850
post it to what we call publishers and publishers allow your posts to be discovered by others.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.460
And it's very simple to do.

11:33.460 --> 11:39.280
You can write a blog post on medium in a day and submit it to a place like Hakkar noon and lots of people

11:39.280 --> 11:48.040
see it and as soon as you show this to a recruiter or an interviewer again it automatically shows that

11:48.370 --> 11:53.050
you know what you're talking about or at least it makes you stand out from the rest and you can do this

11:53.050 --> 11:54.320
with YouTube videos as well.

11:54.340 --> 11:59.820
But I prefer writing because it's a lot faster and it looks a lot more professional.

11:59.880 --> 12:05.030
So let's just review here what happens if you don't have enough experience.

12:05.040 --> 12:10.980
Well all of these four points allow you to gain that experience or show that you have experience without

12:11.670 --> 12:15.060
actually having traditional work experience.

12:15.420 --> 12:21.360
All you need to do is start something on your own and build something like a project or a portfolio

12:21.390 --> 12:23.550
or a blog post.

12:23.580 --> 12:29.000
This only shows initiative but you can focus this project on solely getting your interviews.

12:29.010 --> 12:37.030
Or you can participate in a hackathon or contribute to open source projects by taking this initiative

12:37.030 --> 12:43.950
you're doing more than most people that hope to just land an interview by sending a generic resume.

12:43.960 --> 12:48.640
You'll immediately stand out from the crowd and give you something to put on your resume that again

12:48.820 --> 12:51.080
is different than the average developer.

12:52.800 --> 12:57.950
Plus you have the added benefit of something to talk about in your actual interview.

12:59.080 --> 13:05.780
Remember nothing is given to you for free and luck is for those who rather wait and go after what they

13:05.780 --> 13:11.310
want so by simply holding something just for fun such as a side project.

13:11.480 --> 13:15.290
You're showing how self-motivated and ambitious you are.

13:15.290 --> 13:18.480
Experience doesn't mean on the job experience.

13:18.530 --> 13:21.370
Write about your portfolio projects.

13:21.620 --> 13:24.410
Maybe talk about your website and how you built it.

13:24.410 --> 13:29.720
Talk about your get high profile maybe a hackathon you participate in and or open source projects you've

13:29.720 --> 13:31.070
worked on.

13:31.070 --> 13:37.910
Write a blog post on a specific technology that the company you're applying to is using all of them.

13:37.910 --> 13:40.970
Answer this question Do you have experience.

13:41.160 --> 13:47.280
Finally there are many things that you can add that are not developer related but can make you a great

13:47.280 --> 13:48.060
employee.

13:48.060 --> 13:51.420
For example did you work as an instructor at a camp.

13:51.750 --> 13:57.070
Well you can now add ability to manage people and communicate well with others.

13:57.120 --> 14:01.310
Any skill that is related to getting the job done can be included.

14:02.120 --> 14:08.400
Also if you have only had six months of coding experience don't show that on the resume.

14:08.480 --> 14:16.550
That doesn't mean to lie but to hide that information because a recruiter only glances at your resume

14:16.760 --> 14:21.140
they won't care if you're the best of all in the world if they just see six months experience that's

14:21.140 --> 14:22.670
too risky for them.

14:22.670 --> 14:26.730
Your resume will most likely be discarded no matter how good of a developer you are.

14:26.750 --> 14:34.130
So remember resumes are only good to get your foot in the door by tweaking your resume to show that

14:34.130 --> 14:40.280
you have experience so that the recruiter thinks oh interviewing this person is low risk because they

14:40.280 --> 14:43.380
know what they're talking about is a good way of doing it.

14:44.470 --> 14:50.080
Do you have past experience having made good decisions in the past and have you worked on a challenging

14:50.080 --> 14:51.740
problem and solve them.

14:51.760 --> 14:59.710
If you're able to answer yes to that well then a recruiter is most likely going to ask for an interview.

14:59.740 --> 15:00.660
I'll see you in the next video.
