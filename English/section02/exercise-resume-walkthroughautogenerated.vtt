00:01.190 --> 00:02.210
Welcome back.

00:02.210 --> 00:04.200
It's time for a fun little exercise.

00:04.220 --> 00:08.770
Well I mean resumes are never fun but I'm going to try and make this fun.

00:08.990 --> 00:10.060
I might succeed might not.

00:10.100 --> 00:10.930
Let's have a look.

00:11.180 --> 00:11.680
OK.

00:11.690 --> 00:17.660
Before we get started I have a resume cheat sheet for you that we're going to go to and this is what

00:17.660 --> 00:18.350
you can do.

00:18.350 --> 00:24.170
I've simplified everything so that you do these items and you're already above average with your resume

00:24.170 --> 00:28.660
and you're going to see some increase in the number of interviews you're going to get.

00:28.700 --> 00:34.330
But before we get into that I want to show you again this Web site that we already talked about the

00:34.360 --> 00:36.390
resume maker online.

00:36.490 --> 00:43.990
Now I like this Web site because it shows you what part the interviewer actually cares about or the

00:43.990 --> 00:45.720
recruiter actually cares about.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.290
If you look over here we see that we see the title we see professional experience maybe a bit of education

00:53.560 --> 00:55.110
and then the left hand side.

00:55.390 --> 00:59.420
I don't think you need birthdate or nationality but you get the idea.

00:59.620 --> 01:05.680
A recruiter usually only checks out the main points and from there if they're interested in you they'll

01:05.680 --> 01:12.870
read further but you want to focus on these main points where a recruiters eyes are going to be drawn.

01:13.060 --> 01:19.330
So that right away within the first second they see that you are a qualified candidate.

01:19.330 --> 01:26.670
So keeping that in mind let's go over the points.

01:26.670 --> 01:26.990
All right.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.220
So I have the cheat sheet here and I have here a demo resume that I just randomly found online.

01:34.230 --> 01:36.720
Now before we get started here.

01:36.810 --> 01:45.530
Well you make this a little bit bigger so you can see you can pause the video here and have a look at

01:45.530 --> 01:51.770
this resume and see how you might want to improve it or you can even bring up your own resume so that

01:51.800 --> 01:54.800
as we go along with each point you can critique your resume.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.000
All right so pause the video.

01:56.060 --> 01:59.390
Otherwise I'm going to get started.

01:59.640 --> 02:06.700
Now this resume Chichi the first item on it is does it use a pre-designed resume template.

02:06.830 --> 02:08.660
And if we take a look at this resume.

02:08.670 --> 02:16.060
Well I mean it looks like somebody just wrote it in Microsoft ward with the most basic font and it doesn't

02:16.060 --> 02:19.280
look very pretty right away from a recruiter looking at this.

02:19.300 --> 02:23.860
I'm not going to be impressed and I'm going to associate low skills with the person that doesn't have

02:23.860 --> 02:25.260
a well-designed resume.

02:25.450 --> 02:32.620
So again you might want to use a tool like the one I showed you that has pre-designed templates so everything

02:32.620 --> 02:37.080
looks good and professional so we can fix that resume that way.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.500
Nice and easy fix.

02:38.830 --> 02:39.890
What about the next one.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.290
Make the resume fit on one page.

02:43.290 --> 02:47.950
I've said this numerous times and you know what this person has the resume on one page.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.260
That's a nice easy one.

02:49.350 --> 02:50.600
Good job.

02:50.610 --> 02:52.130
What about the next one.

02:52.260 --> 02:54.760
Include words from job description.

02:55.170 --> 03:00.340
If I go into this resume I don't know what this person was applying to.

03:00.420 --> 03:06.040
But again the very first items which is what a recruiter is going to look at is going to read.

03:06.120 --> 03:12.270
I wish to obtain a web graphic design position where my unique technical and creative experience will

03:12.270 --> 03:13.260
be valuable.

03:13.260 --> 03:18.480
Having worked in media I am familiar with the fast paced environment keeping tight deadlines and maybe

03:18.480 --> 03:20.910
some technical knowledge and work experience.

03:21.180 --> 03:25.390
But just by reading this resume I have no idea what this person is applying to.

03:25.560 --> 03:32.210
I just see that while they're looking for a web graphic design position but it's not very specific.

03:33.050 --> 03:36.470
We want to include words from the actual job description.

03:36.580 --> 03:42.190
If they're looking for a front end developer make sure that the front end developer may be Javascript

03:42.190 --> 03:46.800
is included in your objectives or technical knowledge right at the beginning.

03:47.750 --> 03:50.950
Again key words are those words that people are going to see.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.920
Recruiters are going to see or even machines that are reading your resume are going to see and say oh

03:55.280 --> 03:59.270
this person is the type of candidate that we want.

03:59.310 --> 04:00.490
Let's look at the next one.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.940
Include company name you're applying to.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.700
This is so simple to do.

04:06.770 --> 04:12.500
And right away puts you above most resumes you see over here that this person has really included that

04:13.010 --> 04:20.660
ideally you've added to the objective or maybe summary or the title the company name or something specific

04:20.660 --> 04:26.930
to that company that you want to improve maybe the company is looking for engineers who can improve

04:26.930 --> 04:31.020
their infrastructure well should definitely have those awards.

04:31.130 --> 04:37.950
And that phrase in your objective All right off to the next one.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.190
Does your first item on your resume reflect what you are looking for or what they are looking for the

04:45.190 --> 04:46.900
companies looking for.

04:46.990 --> 04:54.160
Again this kind of goes hand-in-hand with the job description and the company name but your technical

04:54.160 --> 04:58.210
knowledge your objective your experience should be.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.180
Exactly.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.950
Especially the very first items should be exactly what they're looking for.

05:04.120 --> 05:10.570
Again if you don't include those words and you give them something random like this person has a company

05:10.570 --> 05:14.700
name here and a company link of some that they've worked in the past.

05:14.890 --> 05:21.440
Well I don't really care and if I look over here at the first item that I see is a of mine if they're

05:21.460 --> 05:27.490
applying for a web graphic design position issue most probably not the most important here item here.

05:27.490 --> 05:33.800
So again whoops I can't I don't really care about that.

05:33.840 --> 05:34.140
All right.

05:34.140 --> 05:35.350
Off to the next point.

05:35.370 --> 05:36.540
We're flying through this.

05:36.540 --> 05:41.160
It's not that bad is it experienced titles demonstrate value.

05:41.160 --> 05:45.700
Probably the most poorly worded sentence I have come up with.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.410
But let me explain what it means.

05:48.450 --> 05:51.730
The experience title should demonstrate value.

05:51.870 --> 06:00.600
That is the work experience which is usually the main part of the resume should show that you provide

06:00.600 --> 06:01.760
value.

06:01.830 --> 06:08.310
If I go into this person's resume the first sentence I'm going to read is that a company's name that

06:08.310 --> 06:13.230
they've worked out that I've never heard of web M.D. which is a big web site so I've heard of them and

06:13.230 --> 06:15.210
then I see web producer.

06:15.540 --> 06:22.420
And then again responsibility includes updating a shemale content doesn't really demonstrate a lot of

06:22.420 --> 06:24.000
value here.

06:24.010 --> 06:30.970
Instead you want to make sure that your work experience shows a value that is instead of having the

06:30.970 --> 06:31.980
company name here.

06:31.990 --> 06:40.810
Unless it's a big company like Amazon Netflix or Alibaba something with a lot of good recognition I

06:40.810 --> 06:44.030
don't really care about the company I care about what you did.

06:44.050 --> 06:48.790
Web producer that sounds a lot more impressive than this company name so this should be bolded and highlighted

06:49.430 --> 06:50.490
production coater.

06:50.490 --> 06:55.570
Again more important that web and the art director get more important.

06:55.570 --> 07:03.340
So you want to make sure that that's highlighted that those are the key things that shows you are valuable.

07:03.340 --> 07:10.630
Another thing is if you look at the sentence over here this HMO part doesn't sound impressive but the

07:10.630 --> 07:17.000
second part cropping retouching optimizing photos for creation of thumbnails and other images.

07:17.440 --> 07:23.260
I mean you could reword that and make that sound better such as improving performance of the Web site

07:23.710 --> 07:32.730
by optimizing assets such as photos having those force items demonstrate value is very very important.

07:32.860 --> 07:35.110
And this is actually over here as well.

07:35.110 --> 07:40.530
When we go to technical knowledge we see that the second item is M-S office Microsoft Office.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.930
I mean everybody knows how to use Word.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.680
It's not very impressive.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.750
Maybe adding Adobe Creative Suite.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.880
Photoshop Illustrator flash at the beginning.

07:49.900 --> 07:54.840
If you're applying for a web design graphic position is more important than Microsoft Office.

07:54.840 --> 08:00.310
And again even the sentence I've been hand-coding Ishmael for nine years says for four years.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.310
Web master done ph be my skill.

08:03.310 --> 08:06.310
Why is that so small and underneath everything.

08:06.370 --> 08:10.000
A recruiter is going to see this without reading this full sentence.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.660
That's probably the most valuable part of the resume.

08:12.670 --> 08:17.120
This should probably be up over here again making those key items.

08:17.130 --> 08:23.490
Remember this image that I showed you the very highlighted items the most important thing.

08:23.580 --> 08:23.920
All right.

08:23.980 --> 08:25.650
I think I've talked about that point enough.

08:25.720 --> 08:26.930
Let's go to the next one.

08:28.590 --> 08:30.190
Do you have an online link.

08:30.250 --> 08:35.910
Again if you're applying to be a web graphic design designer and for people taking this course you're

08:35.910 --> 08:38.350
most likely some sort of an engineer.

08:38.520 --> 08:42.570
You should have some sort of an online link to your get help profile.

08:42.630 --> 08:49.120
Maybe blog posts maybe Web site portfolio he needs to be at the very top.

08:49.290 --> 08:57.220
Next one remove the word hi I wish to obtain I am familiar.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.000
I was hired.

08:59.400 --> 09:04.340
I meet all those sentences doesn't really tell me anything.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.810
You're adding extra weight again.

09:07.830 --> 09:12.960
You only have a few seconds to impress a recruiter and you adding these extra items that we don't really

09:12.960 --> 09:13.800
care about.

09:14.100 --> 09:19.820
As a recruiter we want to know right away what you can offer us what type of asset you would be.

09:19.980 --> 09:21.220
I have been.

09:21.420 --> 09:22.440
We don't really care about that.

09:22.440 --> 09:29.010
Instead legist say something like professional web graphic designer with five years of experience.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.870
To the point right away.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.410
Again we don't care about.

09:32.420 --> 09:37.450
I have been coding or any of those eyes get to the point right away.

09:37.490 --> 09:43.790
Speak in the third person if you want to just make sure right away the first sentence that they read

09:44.150 --> 09:47.540
are the key words and important items on the list.

09:47.540 --> 09:52.520
Let's look at the next one no buzzwords describing how great you are.

09:52.640 --> 09:53.250
And you know what.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.710
This person definitely undersells themselves.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.410
I think this resume could be a lot better.

09:58.430 --> 10:01.760
This person definitely does not over inflate themselves.

10:01.970 --> 10:07.330
But what I mean by buzzwords is don't put garbage on your resume.

10:07.330 --> 10:08.930
That doesn't mean anything.

10:09.020 --> 10:16.220
So words or phrases such as thought leader passionate entrepreneur and sometimes people actually think

10:16.220 --> 10:22.870
negatively on these of terms don't tell the recruiter him or her what to think about you.

10:23.210 --> 10:29.720
And we want to focus on using something called action words and that's actually the next point.

10:31.280 --> 10:35.350
Instead of using vague terms that don't really mean anything.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.760
We want action words.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.840
What did you do and what were the results.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.550
And you can be really creative here.

10:42.800 --> 10:49.730
Every time you do something with code see how you add it to your resume as an action and an end result.

10:49.730 --> 10:54.170
It's very easy to just list your responsibilities kind of like this person has done.

10:54.260 --> 10:56.340
But what did you actually do.

10:56.570 --> 11:02.060
And I mean this sentence is actually pretty impressive over here the content or not this one over here

11:03.270 --> 11:08.900
testing the content management system and seeing that migration to the news servers is running smoothly.

11:09.120 --> 11:15.300
I mean that sounds a lot more impressive than coding as G-mail web pages actual words perhaps should

11:15.300 --> 11:22.740
be testing deploying and observing content management systems to production servers maybe some monitoring

11:22.740 --> 11:29.460
there but you want to show exactly what you did and then perhaps even say what were the results that

11:29.550 --> 11:32.340
the customer experience improved.

11:32.370 --> 11:37.900
Or that more customers came to the Web site because of this transition to production servers.

11:37.980 --> 11:44.630
And again this translates into the next point we want to measure everything in terms of impact and don't

11:44.630 --> 11:47.800
just describe your responsibilities.

11:47.870 --> 11:54.350
We want to show off what we've actually done for a company like web M.D..

11:54.420 --> 11:56.990
Ideally you have some sort of numbers such as.

11:57.020 --> 12:03.120
BI How much did you improve the website performance by optimizing the photos and thumbnails.

12:03.120 --> 12:11.500
How much did the traffic of web M.D improve because of this migration to New servers.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.720
By having numbers it's a lot more tangible.

12:14.790 --> 12:19.770
As a recruiter I can see the impact that you had on the business because let's be honest your companies

12:19.770 --> 12:25.320
hire people that are assets that improve the company and create more revenue for them.

12:25.320 --> 12:30.010
So if you're able to demonstrate that in a past job that you've actually here are the numbers.

12:30.030 --> 12:31.990
This is how I improved the company.

12:32.100 --> 12:35.550
Well then you for sure are going to be a good hire.

12:35.910 --> 12:38.510
All right let's talk about the next one we're almost done here.

12:38.520 --> 12:43.920
Hang with me here I know resumes not the funnest topic but I promise you it's going to get better and

12:43.920 --> 12:44.670
better.

12:45.090 --> 12:51.110
So technical knowledge skills should include what they are looking for only show years.

12:51.150 --> 12:53.200
If it is impressive.

12:54.230 --> 13:02.480
So over here this person when I say years I guess I'm saying hey if you worked at this company only

13:02.480 --> 13:03.640
for a month or two months.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.020
Well that's not very impressive.

13:05.180 --> 13:10.970
But if you have a certain number of years of experience this person has nine years that they've been

13:10.970 --> 13:15.320
coding on HD Ammal CSSA for four years.

13:15.410 --> 13:19.910
I mean that's nine years of experience so you're going to have to mention G-mail or CSSA that you can

13:19.910 --> 13:25.780
just say that you're a weap and graphic designer with nine years of experience.

13:25.790 --> 13:27.710
I mean that sounds impressive.

13:29.030 --> 13:33.350
And you also want to make sure that these technical skills is what they're looking for.

13:33.490 --> 13:37.740
I doubt they're looking for M-S office or laptop PC hardware knowledge.

13:37.760 --> 13:44.310
They're probably looking for Photoshop Illustrator maybe SS Maybe BHP ask you all.

13:44.510 --> 13:46.650
Maybe it's a react.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.590
J Yes position you are applying for.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.930
You want to make sure that you show up those skills.

13:50.960 --> 13:55.810
And if you have many years of experience with them make sure you include that number.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.380
If you don't have that many years of experience just don't show the number.

13:59.390 --> 14:02.210
You don't need to tell them everything.

14:02.320 --> 14:02.800
All right.

14:02.800 --> 14:08.230
Last two items include only sections items that are impressive.

14:08.330 --> 14:12.670
Experienced projects education technical skills.

14:12.670 --> 14:18.400
This just says hey only include items that a recruiter really cares about.

14:18.400 --> 14:25.390
For example if I was an intern at a flower shop five years ago as a recruiter maybe recruiting for a

14:25.390 --> 14:29.840
software engineering role I don't really care about your flower experience.

14:30.010 --> 14:36.160
I mean hey maybe some people do but I doubt that they do only include things that are relevant or can

14:36.160 --> 14:40.250
be and directly improve your odds of getting a job.

14:40.510 --> 14:43.770
You don't want to just fill out a resume just to fill out a resume.

14:43.930 --> 14:49.270
If it doesn't actually add to your overall picture.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.290
Now this person does a pretty good job.

14:51.280 --> 14:57.910
You can see that most of their experiences technical knowledge so that's good but we see over here that

14:58.120 --> 14:59.900
usually you want to include experience.

14:59.950 --> 15:04.190
Maybe you projects education and timing skills anything outside of that.

15:04.330 --> 15:09.160
I mean you can add it but only if you think it'll improve the way the recruiter sees you.

15:09.170 --> 15:12.480
But those four categories should be enough.

15:12.700 --> 15:16.960
And then finally everybody knows this but I had it on here just in case.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.880
No typos or bad grammar.

15:18.910 --> 15:23.800
If you're not a native English speaker or a native speaker of your language make sure you get somebody

15:23.800 --> 15:30.000
to double check your resume that there's no typos but everybody knows that.

15:30.340 --> 15:34.480
All right there was a lot I know I know but hey I'm excited.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.370
Just as you that we're almost.

15:36.460 --> 15:40.660
We're pretty much done with the resume section so we can get into the fun technical part.

15:40.930 --> 15:45.780
But you know people have written books on the topic of how to write resumes.

15:46.150 --> 15:50.110
There's so many things so many minor things they can adjust to make them important.

15:50.110 --> 15:55.990
But if you follow these steps and I'm going to give you this sheet right after this lesson you've pretty

15:55.990 --> 16:01.120
much done 90 percent of the work that is important for you to get a job.

16:01.270 --> 16:06.400
After that you should be focusing on other things such as improving your skills as a developer.

16:06.460 --> 16:12.760
So by just following this simple list I guarantee your percentage of getting interviews is going to

16:12.850 --> 16:14.690
increase at least with resumes.

16:14.710 --> 16:15.380
That's it.

16:15.400 --> 16:21.280
Hopefully by looking at this and your own resume and looking at these checkpoints you can see how you

16:21.280 --> 16:22.710
can improve things.

16:22.720 --> 16:30.610
It's all about wording and how you can get the recruiter to see the top parts to buy you the good things

16:30.610 --> 16:36.700
about you at the very beginning so that it catches their eye and they say hmm I'm going to keep reading

16:36.790 --> 16:40.690
or I'm going to give this person an interview so I can find out more.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.750
Now that's enough for resumes.

16:42.760 --> 16:48.520
There are books written on the topic but you have to remember that there's simply a way to get interviews

16:48.820 --> 16:49.880
and such.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.250
Treat them that way.

16:51.490 --> 16:53.900
Don't overcomplicate them.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.720
But I hope you get the general goal here.

16:55.780 --> 17:01.750
Every word in her resume she convinced the recruiter why they should hi.

17:01.990 --> 17:03.870
I'll see in the next video.
