Welcome back Lincoln is one of the best things that has happened to the job market.

00:07.650 --> 00:13.800
Now depending on your geographic location you'll see different levels of activity for Linked-In.

00:13.830 --> 00:19.230
So this is something that you'll have to consider for yourself and make sure that linked in is a good

00:19.230 --> 00:20.670
option for your location.

00:21.910 --> 00:28.720
Now let's have a look at Linked-In so we can talk about it and also to see if it's a viable option for

00:28.840 --> 00:29.610
yourself.

00:29.860 --> 00:36.550
The best way to actually see if it's worth your time to invest in a LinkedIn profile is to actually

00:36.550 --> 00:43.590
just do a search for jobs and in here you can do all sorts of filters.

00:43.670 --> 00:51.350
But if I go to all filters you can look for jobs based on your location and the type of job that you're

00:51.350 --> 00:58.670
looking for if there are jobs then perhaps you need a LinkedIn profile because well this is a great

00:58.670 --> 01:05.840
way to apply to jobs which you can do on LinkedIn but also have recruiters contact you through Linked-In

01:06.110 --> 01:09.650
which actually happens a lot.

01:09.650 --> 01:12.890
And we're going to get into that a little bit later.

01:12.900 --> 01:20.850
I personally think that Linked-In is a hundred percent better than resumes and it's something that every

01:20.850 --> 01:22.490
single person should have.

01:22.490 --> 01:29.930
Especially if you want a job and the tech industry and by the way I'm no specialist when it comes to

01:29.930 --> 01:35.910
Linked-In and there's a lot of people in books that talk about how to optimize these things.

01:35.930 --> 01:41.990
However if you craft things well enough you'll find you'll get contacted by recruiters constantly on

01:42.080 --> 01:43.020
Linked-In.

01:43.040 --> 01:50.690
I actually have to add on my profile a little bit of no recruiters please because our to get contacted

01:50.690 --> 01:54.850
so often by recruiters from my experience speaking with other people.

01:54.920 --> 02:00.800
When you have a good LinkedIn profile you'll get contacted for job offers which again is a great thing

02:00.800 --> 02:07.360
to have in the back of your pocket as an extra way to increase those odds of getting an interview.

02:07.730 --> 02:11.680
So here's the keys to Linked-In fast and quick.

02:12.810 --> 02:16.650
Number one is to look for jobs and apply to jobs through LinkedIn.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.620
Again I showed you how to do that.

02:18.660 --> 02:26.640
You can see what jobs are available and actually apply to them directly linked in is pretty much like

02:26.640 --> 02:30.990
your resume so it should have very similar items on your resume.

02:31.140 --> 02:33.460
Whatever makes your profile complete.

02:33.600 --> 02:40.000
Well you should add it over here just like I have done for myself.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.040
Now the interesting thing here is that recruiters for other companies and tech recruiters usually search

02:47.040 --> 02:50.170
Linked-In for candidates and what they do is they you.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.420
Keyword searches.

02:51.420 --> 02:57.750
So if I'm a recruiter looking for let's say a Python developer I'm going to google Python developer

02:57.750 --> 03:00.800
and maybe check that a Linked In profile.

03:00.830 --> 03:03.230
How's the word Python in it.

03:03.240 --> 03:09.130
Maybe I'll check that if I scroll down here that their indoor skills where are they.

03:10.630 --> 03:17.920
That skills in endorsements that this person has Python and perhaps whether this person changed their

03:17.920 --> 03:20.850
profile recently and that's a little trick.

03:20.860 --> 03:26.440
Update your profile every week when you're looking for a job on Linked-In since it's going to show up

03:26.440 --> 03:29.070
in a recruiters search result.

03:29.080 --> 03:35.470
So even if it's a small change such as just a little typo or a little space it's going to show up as

03:35.470 --> 03:36.480
an updated profile.

03:36.490 --> 03:42.610
And recruiters are actually going to see that this person changed their profile recently which means

03:42.610 --> 03:46.040
they're more likely to be looking for a job and they're more likely to reach out to you.

03:46.180 --> 03:51.670
So you can actually just do this every couple of days when you're looking for a job so that it increases

03:51.670 --> 03:55.370
your odds of you getting onto recruiters search results.

03:56.290 --> 04:01.780
You also want to include keywords that recruiters are looking for and I have an example here for you

04:01.840 --> 04:05.120
if I scroll to one of my positions here.

04:05.710 --> 04:08.840
I have a list of my favorite tools in 2017.

04:09.580 --> 04:16.980
And I actually did this strategically because all these tools that I'm using are now key words that

04:17.310 --> 04:26.430
if a recruiter or companies looking for somebody with Mongo DB experience or maybe server less architecture

04:26.430 --> 04:33.600
or Firebrace or any of these things my profile includes those so I'm going to show up in those results.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.710
So think of it that way.

04:34.710 --> 04:38.240
What are the key words that will make you more approachable.

04:38.960 --> 04:43.680
Finally try to get recommendations from other people.

04:43.880 --> 04:50.010
Message your friends or colleagues or coworkers and get them to refer you.

04:50.150 --> 04:57.470
That recruiters or companies will read this but again when your profile shows up in searches it's more

04:57.470 --> 05:01.580
likely to be ranked higher up because you have these recommendations.

05:02.310 --> 05:09.990
By the way these skills and endorsements are things that will usually you get from people such as your

05:09.990 --> 05:11.300
connections on Linked-In.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.490
It's really hard to get this number up.

05:13.590 --> 05:19.620
So I've actually created a little group for us where if I go to groups and by the way Linked-In is updating

05:19.620 --> 05:26.490
these so it's going to actually change most likely from how you see it in the video.

05:26.490 --> 05:33.270
And here we have members that you can connect with and actually ask for referrals skills and endorsement

05:33.690 --> 05:36.070
just to again boost your LinkedIn profile.

05:37.120 --> 05:42.760
Finally something that we're going to talk about in the email section but some of the best way to get

05:42.760 --> 05:49.960
jobs is to not just blindly email companies that don't know anything about you getting referrals or

05:49.960 --> 05:55.110
being referred by somebody within the company is one of the best ways to do that.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.790
And for me myself I'm not very sociable.

05:57.790 --> 06:02.710
I don't really like networking and going to events or perhaps maybe I don't know somebody at a company

06:02.710 --> 06:05.280
and there's no way for me to get a referral.

06:05.470 --> 06:13.500
Well Linked-In allows us to do this by simply searching for let's say Netflix.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.350
I want to work on Netflix.

06:15.430 --> 06:24.880
I'm going to click on this company or actually if we go back and do Netflix and click on Netflix in

06:24.890 --> 06:29.850
people I'm going to look for people that work in Netflix if it works.

06:30.290 --> 06:38.390
You go a little bit slow there and I see here people that actually work on Netflix and some my connections

06:38.390 --> 06:44.770
to them I see that I have shared connections and I can message somebody I can connect with them.

06:45.170 --> 06:50.360
I can also see that this person is actually a recruiter and Netflix and I have some sort of a shared

06:50.360 --> 06:51.110
connection.

06:51.290 --> 06:57.810
Maybe I saw her message her and see if I can get an introduction or maybe I can pass my resume onto

06:57.860 --> 07:00.040
her or set up a phone interview.

07:00.050 --> 07:06.980
In other words Linked-In allows us to see that we have mutual friends and we can't vouch for each other's

07:06.980 --> 07:11.060
credibility or perhaps contact somebody directly.

07:11.070 --> 07:13.760
Netflix that can get us an interview.

07:13.910 --> 07:19.040
Again it's all about being strategic and efficient and doing what most people aren't willing to do which

07:19.040 --> 07:20.870
will make you stand up.

07:20.890 --> 07:21.300
All right.

07:21.370 --> 07:26.070
So to review update your LinkedIn profile with the skills that you have.

07:26.070 --> 07:31.530
And according to the jobs that you're targeting recruiters are going to use Linked-In to look for candidates

07:31.830 --> 07:37.290
and they'll always search for users who have recently changed their profiles since it signals to them

07:37.320 --> 07:39.230
that this person's looking for a job.

07:39.630 --> 07:45.690
And also try to include the relevant skills and have those keywords ready so that you do show up in

07:45.690 --> 07:47.230
those search your souls.

07:47.250 --> 07:50.840
You can also apply to jobs directly through Linked-In.

07:51.060 --> 07:56.460
And you can also find people or companies that you want to work for that you can connect with message

07:56.730 --> 08:03.240
or get referrals from Again something we'll talk a little bit more in detail in our email section using

08:03.240 --> 08:09.660
a tool like this that allows you to be discovered while you're sleeping just optimizes your chance of

08:09.660 --> 08:16.500
getting interviews without making you spend a ton of time trying to get those interviews again so you

08:16.500 --> 08:18.290
can focus on things that really matter.

08:19.590 --> 08:21.610
I'll see in the next video Buh-Bye.
