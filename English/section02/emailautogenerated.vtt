00:00.940 --> 00:06.950
Welcome back to our fourth and last item on the list emails.

00:07.180 --> 00:14.240
Now if you're applying directly via a company's website or through a job board please stop.

00:14.690 --> 00:15.100
All right.

00:15.130 --> 00:19.800
Don't actually stop but realize it's not the best way.

00:19.810 --> 00:22.070
It's what everybody else does.

00:23.050 --> 00:29.410
There's a study that was published by a company called mbak group and they looked at some of the job

00:29.410 --> 00:36.810
applications and did some statistics around those numbers and they found that close to 30 percent of

00:36.850 --> 00:42.240
hires made by organizations actually came from referrals.

00:42.280 --> 00:47.440
So that is employees referring their friends or somebody that they know to the company.

00:47.530 --> 00:52.840
It was the number one way of companies to hire other people.

00:52.870 --> 01:00.580
And again part of this study also discovered that 46 percent of men and 39 percent of women actually

01:00.580 --> 01:04.660
find their jobs most of their jobs through networking.

01:04.660 --> 01:10.210
The interesting thing is that the higher your salary the more effective networking becomes and getting

01:10.210 --> 01:11.210
a referral.

01:11.320 --> 01:16.930
For most companies the best way to get an interview is not only through online job boards but the best

01:16.930 --> 01:20.360
way to get an interview is through referrals.

01:20.770 --> 01:26.500
But lucky for you this doesn't have to be an actual friend or a coworker.

01:26.500 --> 01:31.680
Usually you can message people within a company using some of the tools that I'm going to show you.

01:31.690 --> 01:35.800
All right let's get started and show you the first example.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.870
All right.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.210
The first way.

01:38.610 --> 01:44.640
Well the most obvious way is to actually apply to companies where your friends and colleagues can refer

01:44.640 --> 01:51.080
you but maybe that's not the case for everybody and that's kind of rare as I've shown you in the linked

01:51.080 --> 01:52.170
in video.

01:52.170 --> 01:58.650
There are ways for you to actually connect with employees through Linked In and message them based on

01:58.860 --> 02:03.830
who you're connected with and you can easily send them a polite or smart e-mail.

02:03.870 --> 02:09.500
And this is an example template that I'll share with you that i actually a user.

02:09.500 --> 02:14.880
Patrick McKenzie on Hacker News shared and it's a it's a really really good piece of text.

02:14.880 --> 02:21.420
I'm not going to read it out for you but you can see over here a short e-mail to get yourself a referral

02:21.480 --> 02:26.880
or at least talk to some of the developers of the company or some of the key players that might get

02:26.880 --> 02:28.040
you an interview.

02:28.140 --> 02:34.120
But again how can we solve this problem of finding the people to contact.

02:34.330 --> 02:37.110
The one way to do this is using Linked-In.

02:37.150 --> 02:41.860
Like I showed you I can see what jobs say Netflix is hiring for.

02:41.860 --> 02:48.480
I can see some of their employees here can see that I have some connections here from my school.

02:48.760 --> 02:55.720
So that's an easy way but what if you're not able to use LinkedIn are able to find these connections.

02:55.720 --> 03:00.840
There are some great tools that you can use to find in this day and age pretty much anybody's email

03:01.780 --> 03:04.240
and I'll link to this after this lesson.

03:04.240 --> 03:11.290
But you have a lot of plug ins such as this one over here that finds e-mails of lignin profiles.

03:11.500 --> 03:16.930
You have Hunter over here that you go on a Web site and it shows you what e-mails are associated with

03:16.930 --> 03:25.360
the Web site and other tools like email extractor using that you can target somebody that might be a

03:25.360 --> 03:32.350
gatekeeper that is somebody that can make the decision to interview you or not interview you or can

03:32.350 --> 03:35.810
refer you to somebody that has that decision.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.250
Because nothing beats getting a referral from someone.

03:39.370 --> 03:48.320
And the other beauty is that most big companies have incentives for employees who refer someone so they

03:48.320 --> 03:50.140
may actually be willing to help you.

03:50.150 --> 03:51.180
What do I mean by that.

03:52.010 --> 03:59.000
For example my past company if you're able to refer a developer you got an extra bonus on that month's

03:59.150 --> 04:02.580
salary because they're always looking for good employees.

04:03.460 --> 04:09.280
And they know that referrals usually turn out to be better candidates than somebody that just applies

04:09.280 --> 04:14.600
randomly online by contacting some of the people that might be able to refer you.

04:14.620 --> 04:19.960
They actually may be interested as well because they might get a bonus from the company for referring

04:19.960 --> 04:24.980
somebody that they are going to hire and thus improve the company.

04:26.310 --> 04:29.180
Keep in mind that you don't have to just do this online.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.310
You can meet people at meet ups.

04:31.340 --> 04:37.650
You might have locally or even hackathon where you can meet people in real life and ask them if the

04:37.650 --> 04:39.360
company they work for is hiring.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.450
There just so many ways to do it and be smart about it.

04:43.520 --> 04:49.130
Again nothing beats getting a referral from someone they just blindly sending out a resume.

04:49.230 --> 04:50.840
But let's go back to the slides.

04:51.290 --> 04:56.770
The methods we just discussed for e-mailing them getting referrals are pretty basic.

04:56.810 --> 05:00.160
So let's get creative instead of sending your resume.

05:00.200 --> 05:05.450
I usually e-mail a company I'm interested in and again you can use some of the free tools that I showed

05:05.450 --> 05:12.200
you such as email Hunter and instead of sending a resume instead send them a personal web site that

05:12.230 --> 05:18.010
you have a portfolio why you want to work for that company and ask them if you can come by for an interview.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.250
Just ask them outright.

05:19.490 --> 05:26.360
You can send this message to the head H.R. or human resources person or somebody on the development

05:26.360 --> 05:27.150
team.

05:27.380 --> 05:35.240
Another way or even more creative way what message lead developers or CTO is somebody in charge of the

05:35.240 --> 05:42.020
developers or engineers of the company that you're interested in working for them and let them know

05:42.020 --> 05:46.700
that you're interested in getting where they are professionally and ask them to take them for coffee

05:46.820 --> 05:53.090
or lunch or ask them if you can come by to the office to chat with them about their careers so you can

05:53.090 --> 05:54.170
learn from them.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.300
People love talking about themselves.

05:56.300 --> 06:01.230
And if you're not outright asking for a job instead you just want to pick their brain.

06:01.250 --> 06:02.990
Or learn from them.

06:02.990 --> 06:08.170
You might be surprised how often you'd get the yes come by and let's have coffee.

06:08.190 --> 06:10.500
The key here is to just not ask him for a job.

06:11.370 --> 06:17.900
And at the end of meeting them perhaps inquire if they have anybody that they recommend you speak to.

06:18.060 --> 06:22.020
If they're not looking to hire they'll direct you to someone else.

06:22.170 --> 06:28.590
And then finally another way they're like reaching out is to perhaps message CEOs directly or president

06:28.590 --> 06:29.550
of a company.

06:29.550 --> 06:33.890
And this is something that works with smaller companies big large companies.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.440
This most likely won't work.

06:35.820 --> 06:42.570
But if you message a CEO of a startup and ask perhaps what technical problems they are having tell them

06:42.570 --> 06:49.250
what technologies you're an expert in and ask to solve a real life problem that they have free of charge.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.550
They can keep their work and in return all you ask for is an interview.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.480
I mean they might take you up on it because hey why not.

06:56.550 --> 07:02.520
I remember one time when I was a little younger I message the CEO of a really big travel company saying

07:02.520 --> 07:08.430
that the book that they wrote really inspired me and that I'm starting my own travel company and the

07:08.430 --> 07:15.420
CEO and I actually had a meeting and we spoke for about two hours discussing whether I should join his

07:15.420 --> 07:16.300
company or not.

07:16.530 --> 07:17.940
And I never asked him for a job.

07:17.940 --> 07:22.840
It was just something that I sent out again doing things that most people wouldn't do.

07:24.090 --> 07:31.230
But at the end of the day the point of this is to not necessarily send out mass months of resume select

07:31.230 --> 07:36.720
the jobs that you want personalize your e-mails and try to avoid sending a resume if you can try to

07:36.720 --> 07:43.920
bypass formalities of the application process by trying to get her interview right away most likely

07:43.920 --> 07:44.910
during the interview.

07:44.940 --> 07:48.620
They will ask you for a resume but by that point it doesn't really matter.

07:48.630 --> 07:50.110
You've already gotten what you wanted.

07:50.190 --> 07:56.490
They interview by the way you may have noticed that this is why cover letters should be an e-mail to

07:56.550 --> 07:57.910
introduce yourself.

07:58.320 --> 08:02.750
Cover letter should actually be just directed at someone and personalize.

08:02.790 --> 08:05.900
So don't bother creating a generic one.

08:06.200 --> 08:14.820
They're just simply e-mails to reach out to somebody to get referrals to get that interview just write

08:14.820 --> 08:17.280
an e-mail or any way to get connected.

08:17.430 --> 08:21.120
To show how you can help solve their problems.

08:21.180 --> 08:23.090
I'll see in the next video.
