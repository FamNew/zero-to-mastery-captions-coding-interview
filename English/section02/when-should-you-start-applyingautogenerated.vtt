00:01.900 --> 00:05.130
When should I start applying for a job.

00:05.140 --> 00:10.990
This is especially common for people who are looking for their first coding job because they're new.

00:11.150 --> 00:13.640
They're sure how valuable their skills are.

00:13.840 --> 00:19.870
And we all have heard of the imposter syndrome where we think that everybody knows a lot more than us

00:19.900 --> 00:25.180
and that we are just an imposter pretending to be engineers.

00:26.180 --> 00:28.300
So I want to answer this question for you.

00:28.670 --> 00:35.110
A short version and a long version short answer Oh when should you start applying is.

00:35.390 --> 00:44.840
Well now because you need to start looking at interviews not as a win or lose fail or pass rather as

00:44.840 --> 00:45.650
with anything.

00:45.710 --> 00:50.260
It is a skill that you can improve and get better at each interview.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.270
They you go to will make you a better interviewer.

00:53.300 --> 00:57.930
Practicing is the key here and the sooner you start interviewing the better.

00:59.210 --> 01:04.430
Now there is a catch here and we'll need to go into the longer answer for that one.

01:04.580 --> 01:13.010
Assessing readiness is related to calculating the actual value and salary of a developer.

01:13.010 --> 01:14.440
And that's tough to do.

01:15.350 --> 01:19.310
When will you know that you're a front end engineer or a back end engineer.

01:20.210 --> 01:25.850
Most of the time you see on the job description items that you don't even know of or are not the master

01:25.850 --> 01:31.690
of or requiring way more experience or way more years of experience than you have.

01:31.700 --> 01:38.670
First things first companies do this to filter out the weak candidate as a matter of fact if you're

01:38.670 --> 01:44.040
applying to a job where you check all the boxes and you know everything then that means you are getting

01:44.040 --> 01:46.610
a job where you already know what to do.

01:46.710 --> 01:50.520
You won't grow this world as much as tougher positions will you.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.960
So you need to change your mindset here.

01:53.130 --> 02:00.030
A job description is simply a guideline of what type of work you will be doing not what type of work

02:00.420 --> 02:01.830
have you done in the past.

02:02.630 --> 02:08.840
With that said if you don't know how to code at all and you apply for a developer position well don't

02:08.840 --> 02:10.540
expect a positive result.

02:10.580 --> 02:15.030
You need to have some fundamentals before you actually start applying.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.410
Luckily for you the criteria is very simple.

02:18.410 --> 02:24.530
Do you know the fundamental building blocks of computer science like data structures and algorithms

02:24.920 --> 02:31.010
like we're going to learn in discourse in your specific domain have you built some projects and can

02:31.010 --> 02:32.950
build something on your own.

02:33.050 --> 02:36.200
Other than a simple hello world project.

02:36.970 --> 02:43.360
Do you have one or two big projects using the related technologies that the job description has.

02:43.480 --> 02:49.070
If that's the case well be sure to apply your skills so we'll continue to grow in.

02:49.080 --> 02:56.160
I can count numerous times when people in my company got hired over people with more experience because

02:56.160 --> 03:01.770
hiring developers or engineers is more than just technical knowledge.

03:01.770 --> 03:06.230
Once you meet a baseline that is the minimum requirement.

03:06.510 --> 03:12.060
The rest comes down to non-technical parts of the interview again which we have a whole section on in

03:12.060 --> 03:13.260
this course.

03:13.290 --> 03:16.210
So when should you apply now.

03:16.380 --> 03:19.200
Use it as practice just like with anything.

03:19.290 --> 03:22.280
If you wait until you feel you're ready you're ready.

03:22.290 --> 03:23.270
Waited too long.

03:24.460 --> 03:27.210
Remember this quote if you never ask.

03:27.220 --> 03:29.340
The answer is always no.

03:29.350 --> 03:30.640
So start applying now.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.830
I see in the next video Buh-Bye.
