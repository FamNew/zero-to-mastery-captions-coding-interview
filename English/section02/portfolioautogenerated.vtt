00:01.350 --> 00:02.290
Welcome back.

00:02.550 --> 00:04.770
Let's talk about portfolios.

00:04.770 --> 00:11.620
And actually we kind of spoke about this already on our video about what if you don't have enough experience.

00:11.670 --> 00:14.370
So I'm just going to go over a few things.

00:14.370 --> 00:17.390
So I recommend you make sure you watch that video first.

00:18.170 --> 00:22.460
Otherwise let's just recap what our portfolio should be.

00:23.400 --> 00:31.140
A portfolio is simply a way for you to showcase your big projects the items that you want to really

00:31.410 --> 00:33.080
demonstrate your value with.

00:33.150 --> 00:39.280
To talk about in the interview those personal projects should reflect what kind of job you want.

00:39.390 --> 00:42.000
So don't spend a lot of time on your portfolio.

00:42.030 --> 00:47.970
It doesn't really matter that much how it looks unless you're a designer using a free resource like

00:48.210 --> 00:55.440
the one I showed you that gives you free templates where you can list your projects is enough for you

00:55.440 --> 01:00.900
to just have an online link on your resume for recruiters to possibly see that you have some sort of

01:00.900 --> 01:02.300
an online presence.

01:02.340 --> 01:07.510
So using something like this or creative Tim is a great way to just speed up that process.

01:07.540 --> 01:11.740
Remember the project inside this portfolio is what matters most.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.690
You just need to have wanted to big projects you really care about.

01:15.690 --> 01:21.030
I've actually never met a developer that has gotten a job solely because they had a nice portfolio.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.370
So don't stress too much about it.

01:23.370 --> 01:26.850
Remember your goal is just to be seen just to get that interview.

01:26.850 --> 01:30.250
Your portfolio can be quite simple.

01:30.270 --> 01:37.700
I want to make sure that it looks someone nice and that it also loads up fast.

01:39.090 --> 01:43.440
And you just need a place to showcase your main projects.

01:43.590 --> 01:51.510
A place maybe to add your blog posts maybe to add your get Habu account and leave a nice resource for

01:51.510 --> 01:51.860
you.

01:51.870 --> 01:56.760
For some of the best portfolio Web sites but they all pretty much look the same.

01:56.760 --> 02:03.870
A little about me section links to get hub in block posts and just a list of your projects.

02:04.020 --> 02:09.350
You can even have your resume on this portfolio.

02:09.580 --> 02:16.540
And by the way once you're done with your portfolio I recommend you add it to the job board that we

02:16.540 --> 02:22.000
have here so that you can showcase said for other students of the course.

02:22.120 --> 02:28.930
But I also include this on my LinkedIn profile so that when recruiters see my profile they can just

02:29.020 --> 02:37.270
search for developers that they need based on name job title location and it's just a nice way to get

02:37.270 --> 02:41.680
seen or have at least another avenue to be discovered.

02:42.670 --> 02:43.790
And that's it.

02:43.870 --> 02:48.150
Again spend very little time but just have something out there.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
I also recommend going to our Zura to mastery community and actually go into the job hunting section

02:57.810 --> 02:59.870
and we might have a few more channels.

02:59.880 --> 03:04.920
By the time you watch his video but you can check out other people's profiles as well as talk about

03:04.920 --> 03:08.540
job hunting and people sometimes share job openings here.

03:08.550 --> 03:16.200
This is a great place to ask for help get tips and maybe help out community members as well as we all

03:16.260 --> 03:18.050
try and get their dream job.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.510
Anyway I'll see in the next one.

03:21.700 --> 03:21.940
Baba.
