00:01.070 --> 00:02.260
Welcome back.

00:02.330 --> 00:07.820
We're going to answer a question that's kind of simple kind of not depending on your situation.

00:07.970 --> 00:11.270
But I do get asked this question and lossa I want to cover it.

00:11.420 --> 00:13.960
Where to find the jobs.

00:14.210 --> 00:23.670
Now as an engineer as a programmer as a developer we have the skills that are quite in demand.

00:23.900 --> 00:31.460
Most of the time you're not going to find difficulty or it won't be very difficult for you to actually

00:31.460 --> 00:35.590
find companies that hire for your skill sets.

00:35.600 --> 00:41.330
The good news is that the better you get are programming the better you become at engineering.

00:41.630 --> 00:45.080
Well the more doors open up for you.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.340
So that's the good news.

00:46.340 --> 00:48.220
You can always improve your skills.

00:48.350 --> 00:54.550
And we have a highly in-demand skill that allows us a lot of freedom.

00:54.560 --> 00:59.220
So when it comes to where to find the jobs there is a ton of resources out there.

00:59.330 --> 01:04.970
But I'm going to show you my favorite ones that I think are worth your time because again there's so

01:04.970 --> 01:08.270
many options you want to focus on quality over quantity.

01:08.270 --> 01:09.040
Let's have a look.

01:10.930 --> 01:17.140
The first one is Linked-In and it's something we've already talked about but I really do think it's

01:17.140 --> 01:25.450
a great option that if this is available to you in your location then you should be using it 100 percent.

01:25.450 --> 01:29.850
Another place that I like is Hacker News.

01:30.050 --> 01:35.360
So Hacker News a lot of engineers and programmers hang out there and they actually do a monthly who

01:35.360 --> 01:36.360
is hiring.

01:36.430 --> 01:44.480
S. You can see over here when I'm recording this video that they have who is hiring and it shows you

01:44.480 --> 01:49.670
all the companies or people comment with companies that are currently hiring right now again really

01:49.670 --> 01:55.880
really good if you're interested especially startups they sometimes have remote jobs as well which is

01:55.880 --> 01:56.840
really good.

01:56.870 --> 02:04.250
Another great resource if you're specifically looking for startups than Angel list is probably the best

02:04.250 --> 02:05.180
place to go.

02:05.540 --> 02:12.170
So signing up for Angel list creating a profile and finding a job you can work for some of the hottest

02:12.320 --> 02:13.940
startups right now.

02:14.510 --> 02:20.990
If you're looking for remote jobs again I'm going to leave a few more resources after this video but

02:21.290 --> 02:22.880
this is one of my favorite Web sites.

02:22.910 --> 02:29.780
If you want to look for remote jobs again they're becoming more and more common that no matter where

02:29.780 --> 02:36.590
you are in the world as long as you have an Internet connection you can be a developer or programmer

02:36.590 --> 02:41.670
an engineer and work from a company that's thousands of kilometers away.

02:42.550 --> 02:49.120
And I have more and more friends that work remotely as programmers now because more companies are becoming

02:49.180 --> 02:52.040
used to the idea of having remote workers.

02:53.230 --> 03:02.370
Another interesting way to apply for jobs are companies like hired triple bites or white truffle.

03:02.380 --> 03:06.610
They all have pretty cool sounding names except for hired That's pretty generic.

03:06.880 --> 03:14.560
But what they do here is they actually have companies reaching out to them to hire good developers.

03:14.590 --> 03:17.940
So you would take some sort of a quiz a coding quiz with them.

03:17.950 --> 03:24.910
They give you some sort of a rank and they create a profile for you so that companies reach out to them

03:25.420 --> 03:28.860
and look at your score and hopefully hire you.

03:29.440 --> 03:34.120
I'm not the biggest fan of these because it does take a bit of time to take these quizzes.

03:34.120 --> 03:39.640
I like being direct and picking the companies that you want to apply for but they do have some pretty

03:40.000 --> 03:45.980
respectable companies that use some of these Web sites to hire people.

03:47.170 --> 03:54.820
Then there's also meet ups again going to your local meet ups for a specific technology that you're

03:54.820 --> 04:02.380
working with is a great way to network meet people from other companies and potentially see which companies

04:02.380 --> 04:03.130
are hiring.

04:04.300 --> 04:10.780
I personally am not a big fan or networking doesn't seem genuine and kind of seems like I'm faking relationship

04:10.960 --> 04:14.230
but for other people it works really really well.

04:14.290 --> 04:20.860
Again a great way to find people connect with them and especially get referrals.

04:20.910 --> 04:28.530
Finally one of my favorite ways is to do this type of search on Google you see over here I have site

04:28.650 --> 04:37.960
nonstate site Linked-In dot com so search Linked-In dot com and then search for Facebook recruiter if

04:37.960 --> 04:39.930
I want to apply at Facebook.

04:40.200 --> 04:50.560
Well I see over here Colleen Dunn and Juliana are regional recruiters recruiter at Facebook University

04:50.680 --> 04:56.010
recruiter and I can't find specific people that I want to get in touch with.

04:56.020 --> 05:00.980
If I want to work at something like Facebook and I can obviously change this to whatever I want.

05:01.740 --> 05:05.250
And that's a great way to target your approach.

05:05.250 --> 05:10.330
Because remember Job hunting is a numbers game.

05:10.480 --> 05:18.820
A 2 percent chance of getting an interview means all you need to do is apply to 50 places to get an

05:18.820 --> 05:22.110
interview or something along those lines.

05:22.180 --> 05:26.960
You just want to increase your percentage your odds of getting that interview.

05:27.430 --> 05:32.340
Keep that in mind just applying to companies blindly is not a good idea.

05:32.350 --> 05:35.840
I mean you will get interviews but it's not very efficient.

05:35.980 --> 05:42.970
If you have companies you love or you want to work for a specific company sometimes targeting your approach

05:43.330 --> 05:51.880
and focusing in on that company is a lot better more efficient way of spending your time.

05:51.890 --> 05:53.290
Hopefully this was useful.

05:53.300 --> 05:59.540
I'm going to list a bunch of these resources that I showed you and a few others in the next lesson and

05:59.540 --> 06:01.590
I'll see in the next video Buh-Bye.
