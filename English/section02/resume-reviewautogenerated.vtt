00:00.890 --> 00:08.060
Let's quickly review what we know about resumes while they should be wump age.

00:08.220 --> 00:09.030
That's it.

00:09.030 --> 00:10.770
Don't cram everything into it.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.510
Make it clean and simple.

00:12.510 --> 00:16.400
Only include relevant positions and things that make you stand out.

00:16.560 --> 00:21.990
Make the resume be very clear into why you did and don't use any vague language.

00:21.990 --> 00:26.690
I did this and it resulted in this why you did how you did it.

00:27.030 --> 00:33.540
And while were there results make a measurable personalize your resume instead of just emailing a 100

00:33.540 --> 00:34.390
companies.

00:34.560 --> 00:41.770
Try focusing on a few companies and personalize their resume to them and finally make sure there are

00:41.760 --> 00:46.700
some sort of an online presence that they could check out in case they want to find out more about you.

00:47.750 --> 00:52.310
And at the end of the day you have a few seconds to get the person looking at your interview to say

00:53.270 --> 00:56.320
this person is smart and can help this company.

00:57.200 --> 01:02.630
Because remember a resume is a piece of paper that someone will look at for a few seconds to decide

01:02.840 --> 01:06.020
to give you a phone interview or an in-person interview.

01:06.800 --> 01:12.350
So you don't want to spend a lot of time on it but make it so it is effective but it won't get you a

01:12.350 --> 01:12.660
job.

01:12.680 --> 01:18.860
You gotta remember that while we'll get you the job is your projects your interviewing skills.

01:18.860 --> 01:20.390
Things we're going to cover.

01:20.390 --> 01:22.820
Finally be honest with your resume.

01:22.820 --> 01:28.510
Most companies will ask you questions about your resume and they can tell you if you made it up.

01:28.550 --> 01:34.880
It's better to be 100 percent honest and be able to know 100 percent about the project say you worked

01:34.880 --> 01:41.930
on and the resume items because that's something that you're going to talk about in the interview.

01:41.930 --> 01:48.290
I also want to show you a nice little tool their fun little tools like jobs can where you can actually

01:48.530 --> 01:59.810
paste your resume paste the job description and you can scan it and it will tell you how well your resume

01:59.870 --> 02:07.580
does and will give you tips on how you can improve their resume to match the job that you want but you

02:07.580 --> 02:14.760
may have noticed a problem with resumes what if you don't really have that much experience or things

02:14.760 --> 02:15.640
to put down.

02:16.450 --> 02:20.250
What do you do in that case what if I'm underqualified for a job.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.630
What if I've only been a developer for six months.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.790
What if I'm self-taught with no previous experience.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.360
What if I have nothing to put on my resume.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.420
We're going to tackle that question in the next video.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.750
I'll see in that one.

02:35.870 --> 02:36.080
Babai.
