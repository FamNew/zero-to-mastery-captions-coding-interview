Everyone's favorite topic the résumé many people actually enjoy writing their resume but unfortunately

00:10.420 --> 00:12.790
it is a required part of a job search.

00:12.790 --> 00:17.350
Well actually in a later video are you that this is not the case.

00:17.500 --> 00:23.270
But for now let's leave it at that in order to maximize your chances of getting an interview.

00:23.350 --> 00:30.800
You will most likely need a resume a brief document that someone will glance over it about ten seconds

00:30.920 --> 00:37.100
and decide if you are worth talking do for a potential interview or phone interview.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.550
How can we increase the odds here.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.950
Now resumes are being to everyone's existence.

00:42.950 --> 00:50.210
Nobody likes writing them and no employer offers a job just because of somebodies resume.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.820
So you need to treat it accordingly.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.920
Resumes are simply a way to get interviews.

00:56.240 --> 01:00.230
And again you'll see soon that it's not the only way.

01:00.260 --> 01:05.010
Spend very little money of time on your resume no longer than a day.

01:05.090 --> 01:10.330
Look at the types of jobs that you want to have and have the words and characteristics described in

01:10.340 --> 01:13.790
those job postings on your resume.

01:13.790 --> 01:19.910
Finally make it personal for each position you applied do so that employers names is on the resume.

01:19.970 --> 01:26.810
It will take you 10 seconds but by doing just those things it already puts you above most people that

01:26.900 --> 01:30.380
just send mass amount of resumes that look the same.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.080
Now before we get into the details of how to make a resume look good.

01:35.140 --> 01:37.990
I want to show you a really nice tool.

01:38.130 --> 01:40.140
This is the resume maker dot.

01:40.170 --> 01:46.440
Online a free tool that just creates a resume for you or gives you a nice design and template that you

01:46.440 --> 01:50.250
can just fill out yourself there are others like it online.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.140
So you shouldn't really format your own resume.

01:53.390 --> 01:56.210
I mean you're a programmer you are a developer.

01:56.210 --> 02:04.130
You should spend your time coding and use the skills that other people have in design to improve your

02:04.130 --> 02:04.660
resume.

02:04.790 --> 02:09.950
So unless you're a designer you don't really need to focus on making your resume visually appealing

02:10.430 --> 02:13.080
and you can just use a template like this one.

02:13.330 --> 02:17.560
Most of your time like I said is better spent on other things.

02:17.560 --> 02:23.410
And again remember what I said in most cases resumes get viewed for only 10 seconds by a recruiter and

02:23.410 --> 02:28.810
they'll decide quickly if they should contact you for an in-person interview or a phone interview.

02:28.810 --> 02:34.780
Most people spend too much time on the resumes tweaking small things changing fonts and well it's just

02:34.780 --> 02:35.470
a waste of time.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.610
Once you have a good resume that returns a good result then you're all set.

02:39.610 --> 02:40.920
Ancient distress about it.

02:41.020 --> 02:46.030
And keep in mind that some companies that get a lot of resumes don't even have humans actually looking

02:46.030 --> 02:47.170
at their resume.

02:47.350 --> 02:53.710
And initially they have some sort of an algorithm search that looks for keywords on your resume based

02:53.710 --> 02:55.190
on their job description.

02:55.660 --> 02:57.970
So let's go back to the slides now.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.250
I'm going to give you a cheat sheet in the next video and do a bit of an exercise that goes into a little

03:03.250 --> 03:04.410
bit more detail.

03:04.780 --> 03:12.660
But for now let's follow these key points for having a nice resume Resumes should be one page only.

03:12.970 --> 03:17.680
And unless you're an executive or something like that you don't need more than a page.

03:17.680 --> 03:22.520
Second make sure that your resume contains relevant skills.

03:22.540 --> 03:27.340
Each job has a specific requirement and they're looking for specific skills.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.910
These form great keywords to use in your resume.

03:32.050 --> 03:36.670
You can highlight the relevant skills in your professional summary that enables the employer to quickly

03:36.670 --> 03:41.950
get a grasp of the most impressive and important things in your profile.

03:41.950 --> 03:47.420
So again try to use the keywords that they use in the job description in your resume.

03:47.830 --> 03:53.380
Thirdly you want to make it look personal like you didn't just mass email a bunch of companies and one

03:53.380 --> 03:58.530
of the biggest mistakes you can make is to use the same resume for each job application.

03:58.540 --> 04:05.560
That doesn't mean making your resume handcrafted each time spending hours for each company because most

04:05.560 --> 04:08.060
of the time your resume will look the same.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.190
It's very easy to customize your resume though.

04:10.220 --> 04:16.990
Maybe changing a headline or summary section at the top where you can convey in a sentence how you would

04:16.990 --> 04:22.520
fit well with the company or even just mention the particular company you're applying for.

04:22.780 --> 04:29.600
And then finally you want to have some sort of an online link you want to highlight perhaps or get Hobb

04:29.720 --> 04:32.320
your blog posts portfolio Web sites.

04:32.510 --> 04:38.120
As a developer you should have something that is present online for you to showcase to an employer.

04:38.120 --> 04:42.140
As a matter of fact that is more impressive than a resume.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.710
And this is something we'll talk about later in the section.

04:45.010 --> 04:48.460
There should be clearly highlighted on your resume.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.180
All right.

04:49.180 --> 04:54.620
These are just ballpoints and it's kind of hard to explain this without actually showing you a demo.

04:55.090 --> 04:56.970
So it's time for a little exercise.

04:56.980 --> 04:59.390
I have a little resume cheat sheet for you.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.190
And in the next video I'm going to show you an example of a bad resume.

05:03.250 --> 05:06.000
Then use the checklist to see how we can improve it.

05:06.010 --> 05:07.720
I'll see in that one.
