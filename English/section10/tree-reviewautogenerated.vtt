Although there are a ton of trees as you saw and we even talked about a lot of trees the way they worked

00:08.130 --> 00:15.450
though beyond some small logic such as the differences you saw in binary search trees in binary heaps

00:15.450 --> 00:16.720
and priority queues.

00:16.980 --> 00:24.360
As long as you understand how to build one from scratch like we did the small variations are fairly

00:24.360 --> 00:32.020
easy to pick up so that now you have the ability to construct other trees as needed.

00:32.030 --> 00:37.820
Remember that Wikipedia page with a ton of tree data structures they shouldn't look as intimidating

00:37.820 --> 00:39.370
to you anymore.

00:39.770 --> 00:45.950
At the end of the day they're just tree structures with a few different rules apply to them.

00:46.220 --> 00:50.760
Something that you should easily be able to do with a bit of research.

00:50.750 --> 00:50.810
Now.
