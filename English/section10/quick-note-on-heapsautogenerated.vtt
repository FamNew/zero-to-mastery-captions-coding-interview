Welcome back.

00:02.080 --> 00:04.480
I wanted to add a quick gotcha.

00:04.540 --> 00:13.030
When it comes to heaps that is when you hear memory heaps that's not the same as the sheep data structure

00:13.660 --> 00:19.090
you might have heard of memory heaps and something like a javascript runtime engine where we have a

00:19.090 --> 00:20.300
stack and a heap.

00:20.340 --> 00:24.190
There are two locations where we are able to keep memory.

00:24.190 --> 00:30.730
Now this ship you can think of as free storage is a region in our memory where we can store arbitrary

00:30.730 --> 00:31.560
data.

00:31.900 --> 00:35.610
Languages like C also have this heap.

00:35.710 --> 00:38.600
Now the naming is just coincidental.

00:38.660 --> 00:45.060
And he has no real relationship with the data structure that is named heap.

00:45.130 --> 00:45.980
Keep that in mind.

00:46.030 --> 00:48.490
He is simply a heap of memory.

00:48.490 --> 00:55.780
If you're talking about a language runtime for example versus a heap data structure which is what we're

00:55.780 --> 01:01.030
talking about now I want to clarify that for you because when I was learning about heaps.

01:01.030 --> 01:05.730
For some reason I always thought they were the same thing but they're not just throwing it out there.

01:05.770 --> 01:07.230
I'll see him the next video.

01:07.240 --> 01:07.740
Bye.
