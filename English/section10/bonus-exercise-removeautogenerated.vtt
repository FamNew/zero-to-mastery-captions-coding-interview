00:00.700 --> 00:01.570
We'll come back.

00:01.790 --> 00:03.430
We have a bit of a bonus.

00:03.470 --> 00:04.920
Exercise.

00:05.170 --> 00:12.100
Now you can skip over this exercise because it is a little advanced and you most likely won't encounter

00:12.100 --> 00:13.420
it in an interview.

00:13.540 --> 00:20.470
But for those who are curious that is how to implement the Remove method in here.

00:21.600 --> 00:28.430
If we want to remove an item from a tree how would we go about doing it.

00:28.620 --> 00:35.260
Now if you want to try to implement this I want to give you a heads up the best way for you to visualize

00:35.260 --> 00:43.140
and see what steps we need to do is to go back to visual go make sure that you move the speed to the

00:43.140 --> 00:50.720
slowest So you see what's happening and you start removing some notes to see what the logic is.

00:50.730 --> 00:55.180
And removing notes some steps are really easy.

00:55.180 --> 01:02.100
If we wanted to remove one for example is what we simply traverse and find one and just remove it.

01:02.650 --> 01:11.690
But then there's other cases that gets really complicated such as What do we do when we remove 51 well.

01:11.860 --> 01:23.400
If I click play here and say remove 51 Well you'll see that we're going to start traversing to find

01:23.400 --> 01:28.450
51 and notice what happens when we find 51.

01:28.590 --> 01:37.760
We actually keep going to 55 and then we keep going to 54.

01:37.970 --> 01:44.860
And once since we split things and move 54 up.

01:45.170 --> 01:47.390
And I know that's really really confusing.

01:47.390 --> 01:50.690
You might want to do this a couple of times to see what the logic is.

01:51.020 --> 01:56.690
But essentially what we're doing is we're finding where we want to replace going to the right of it

01:57.200 --> 02:01.130
then the left and placing that left item to the top.

02:01.130 --> 02:03.650
Like I said this is going to be a little bit advanced

02:06.930 --> 02:14.700
but if you want to challenge yourself using the visual go animation try to figure out how to implement

02:14.940 --> 02:16.720
your own remove method.

02:17.920 --> 02:24.200
And then the next video I'll show you my solution and go over the steps that we take for this to work.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.330
I'll see in the next one.
