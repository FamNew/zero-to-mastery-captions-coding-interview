Let's learn about the lost data structure in this course graphs graphs are one of the most useful and

00:09.720 --> 00:16.340
most used data structures in computer science when it comes to modeling real life.

00:16.450 --> 00:24.880
In short a graph is simply a set of values that are related in a pair wise fashion and you can see over

00:24.880 --> 00:25.440
here.

00:25.630 --> 00:27.360
It looks like a little network.

00:27.460 --> 00:33.110
There's connections to different nodes in a graph.

00:33.110 --> 00:37.750
Each item is called a node or a vertex.

00:37.970 --> 00:39.670
So this is a node.

00:39.830 --> 00:46.630
This is a node nodes are then connected with edges.

00:46.880 --> 00:54.880
So that's an edge that's an edge and that's a niche and as you can imagine graphs are great data structures

00:54.880 --> 00:57.910
to model real world relationships.

00:57.970 --> 01:04.120
We're presenting length's grass Sorry deal for cases where you're working with things that connect to

01:04.120 --> 01:04.830
other things.

01:04.930 --> 01:07.510
Kind of like how the Internet works.

01:07.510 --> 01:08.590
Right.

01:08.650 --> 01:18.450
We can use graphs to represent maybe friendships maybe family trees we can use graphs to represent networks

01:18.640 --> 01:25.690
and the worldwide web or we can use graphs to represent roads one city to another and the roads that

01:25.690 --> 01:27.850
are connected as you can imagine.

01:27.850 --> 01:30.630
Facebook uses it for their social network.

01:30.640 --> 01:38.740
Amazon uses it for their recommendation engines and Google Maps uses graphs for determining the shortest

01:38.740 --> 01:40.750
path to where you want to go.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.380
So let me ask you a question.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.640
Do you think this is a graph.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.020
Well yeah obviously we just went through it.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.610
What about this.

01:49.690 --> 01:53.040
What about this and this and this.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.190
What about this one.

01:54.190 --> 02:02.560
All right finally this just getting a few more this this and this and this Yep they are all graphs.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.190
Even this one that kind of looks like a linked list.

02:06.190 --> 02:09.390
That's a graph.

02:09.540 --> 02:15.810
And as you can see in our my map graphs encompass things that we've learned before such as trees and

02:15.810 --> 02:20.730
linked lists linked lists are a type of tree.

02:20.730 --> 02:23.350
Trees are a type of graph.

02:23.370 --> 02:26.970
So in the next couple of videos Let's learn all about graphs.
