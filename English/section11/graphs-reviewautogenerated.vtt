Welcome back what are the pros and cons of grafs.

00:05.780 --> 00:13.010
Well when it comes to performance and big-O it gets a little bit complicated because there are so many

00:13.010 --> 00:19.330
different types of graphs you can think of graphs as really useful when it comes to relationships.

00:19.440 --> 00:26.230
They're simply indispensable because some data just needs to be in a graph form.

00:26.570 --> 00:28.260
There's no other way around it.

00:28.550 --> 00:34.580
And there are algorithms around graphs such as the ones we're going to be talking about in the algorithm

00:34.580 --> 00:43.850
section that allows us to perform operations such as finding the shortest path or traversing a graph.

00:44.010 --> 00:50.980
But when it comes to graphs because they can get complicated scaling is pretty hard.

00:51.360 --> 00:57.990
You need a big company or at least a lot of resources and engineering power to make sure that you build

00:58.110 --> 01:01.270
graph data structures that scale well.

01:01.670 --> 01:10.080
But luckily for us you usually will never have to implement your own graph in production or at least

01:10.080 --> 01:10.920
for now.

01:10.950 --> 01:19.690
9 percent of the population there are tools like Neo for J which is a popular database that allows you

01:19.690 --> 01:28.330
to build really fast graph databases and most of the time you'll use tools like this to build complex

01:28.420 --> 01:30.540
structures to contain our data.

01:32.270 --> 01:33.690
Congratulations.

01:33.890 --> 01:39.780
We've now covered another part of our data structure mind map that is graphs.

01:40.160 --> 01:46.470
We learned about six like a acyclic waited on waited directed or undirected.

01:46.530 --> 01:50.590
We were also able to build our own graph.

01:50.600 --> 01:55.730
Now there's still a few things left that I see up there and perhaps over here which we're going to get

01:55.730 --> 01:59.470
into in the algorithm section but for now take a break.

01:59.690 --> 02:03.670
Drink some coffee or tea and I'll see you in the next video.

02:03.670 --> 02:04.340
Bye bye.
