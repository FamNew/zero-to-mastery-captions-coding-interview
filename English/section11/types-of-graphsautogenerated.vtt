As we saw there are many types of graphs but there are certain characteristics that allow us to describe

00:07.330 --> 00:07.990
graphs.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.790
Let's go over them.

00:09.790 --> 00:15.880
One thing that you really want to get yourself familiar with is the idea of directed an on directed

00:15.880 --> 00:16.840
graph.

00:16.930 --> 00:23.440
These types of graphs are useful for describing traffic flow for example of some kind of a system in

00:23.440 --> 00:27.140
which movement is not bi directional.

00:27.220 --> 00:34.180
That means like here where I can go back and forth between notes I can only go in one direction.

00:35.770 --> 00:43.210
A good way to think about on a directed graph is to think of as a highway between two cities where you

00:43.210 --> 00:49.480
can go back and forth on the other hand directed will be a one way street where you can only go one

00:49.480 --> 00:50.100
way.

00:50.470 --> 00:57.150
Another way to think about it is Facebook what kind of graph do you think Facebook has.

00:58.080 --> 01:06.120
Well it has an on directed graph because when I'm connected to a friend that friend is also connected

01:06.120 --> 01:08.530
to me it's not one way.

01:08.580 --> 01:09.570
What about Twitter.

01:10.570 --> 01:20.120
Twitter is more directed because if I have my profile people can follow me and I can follow people.

01:20.230 --> 01:23.770
But if somebody follows me I don't automatically follow them.

01:23.770 --> 01:32.460
So Twitter is more directed another way to describe graphs is the idea of weighted graphs on waited

01:32.550 --> 01:41.110
and waited graphs and as you can see from the images values can be applied to various aspects of a graph.

01:41.220 --> 01:47.670
Not just the notes remember the notes can carry any type of information but with graphs you can also

01:47.670 --> 01:53.490
have information in the edges and the connections maybe you're going on a trip and trying to figure

01:53.490 --> 01:58.490
out the most efficient way to visit sites that interest you.

01:58.650 --> 02:05.370
Well in that case Google Maps would use a weighted graph to decide what is the shortest path for you

02:05.370 --> 02:13.060
to get there and these sort of graphs are used a lot in calculating optimal paths the fastest way to

02:13.060 --> 02:16.790
get to let's say 1 to 6.

02:16.800 --> 02:27.430
Lastly another way to describe graph is cyclic or acyclic when you have vertices connected in a circular

02:27.610 --> 02:28.630
fashion.

02:28.780 --> 02:33.970
It's called a cycle when you can go from one node to another to another and then back to that original

02:33.970 --> 02:40.550
node versus acyclic where you can do that and C-code graphs are really common.

02:40.590 --> 02:49.150
An especially weighted graphs such as Google maps because most of the time there is a way to get back.

02:49.180 --> 02:57.480
So now that we understand a few ways to describe graphs Let me show you my favorite graph of all time.

02:57.570 --> 02:59.820
This is my favorite graph.

03:00.900 --> 03:05.990
It's by the opti project and it is a partial map of the Internet.

03:06.300 --> 03:12.680
If you look here you see that we have IP addresses connecting to IP addresses.

03:12.810 --> 03:17.580
And these are all nodes connected to create the internet.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.210
Pretty spectacular right.

03:19.230 --> 03:24.290
That is the best example of a graph.

03:24.310 --> 03:31.600
So now that we understand or at least have a basic understanding of graphs let's do a nice fun exercise.
