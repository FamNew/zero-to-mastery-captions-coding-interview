There we have it our and to the data structures section was it as scary as you initially thought.

00:09.940 --> 00:15.280
Hopefully by the end of this section if you've watched all the videos and done all the exercises you

00:15.280 --> 00:22.650
feel a lot more comfortable you can use the tools that you've learned to be a better engineer and make

00:22.650 --> 00:24.250
better decisions.

00:24.420 --> 00:30.050
Hopefully you don't look as scared as this emoji dead at the beginning of this section.

00:31.350 --> 00:36.350
And we've learned that these data structures at the end of the day are our friends.

00:36.450 --> 00:38.450
And by the way I'm really proud of this slide.

00:38.460 --> 00:45.120
I spent way too long creating this little thing that I have I have Mr. hash table here.

00:45.270 --> 00:49.070
That's Mrs. Gray that's little linked list.

00:49.250 --> 00:53.960
That's Mr. Q Mrs. Stack's scary looking graph.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.700
And of course Professor tree.

00:56.930 --> 01:05.330
Anyway I hope you're no longer intimidated by the subject because all around us when we look at technology

01:06.050 --> 01:09.140
they're all built by data structures.

01:09.140 --> 01:14.750
We hold information and data structures no matter how many data structures there are and there will

01:14.750 --> 01:15.860
be in the future.

01:16.860 --> 01:19.920
Most of the building blocks are right here.

01:20.660 --> 01:28.640
You see something like block chain that has become really popular in recent years are just data structures

01:28.640 --> 01:36.530
that we've learned about it has some aspects of linked lists it has some hashing that it does which

01:36.530 --> 01:45.120
we know about and it also uses some try data structure and trees having the fundamentals you have now.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.170
One day maybe you'll build your own data structure.

01:49.220 --> 01:50.010
I'll see you in the next one.
