Welcome back.

00:02.300 --> 00:08.600
We have our best friend visual go and once again they have a great diagram for us to play with.

00:09.600 --> 00:16.950
Now I'm going to give you four different graphs and you're going to have to tell me what type of graph

00:16.980 --> 00:25.490
it is based on while we've learned so far whether it's weighted sic click on directed directed.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.030
So let's start off with this one.

00:27.090 --> 00:29.120
What do you think this one is.

00:29.370 --> 00:33.820
Before I show you the answer.

00:33.820 --> 00:38.180
All right well this is an on directed.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.110
There's no arrows on a weighted graph.

00:41.380 --> 00:46.800
And you can see that it's also cyclic because you can go 0 1 2 and back to zero.

00:47.820 --> 00:48.830
What about the next one.

00:51.210 --> 00:52.970
What type of graph is this.

00:55.970 --> 01:04.070
Well this is an undirected weighted graph that's also cyclic.

01:04.240 --> 01:07.190
So you can see that we have weights on the edges here.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.250
There's no arrows.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.110
We can go anywhere.

01:09.110 --> 01:13.630
We won back and forth and we can also make cycles.

01:13.690 --> 01:17.980
What about this one.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.090
This is a directed graph but on weighted and yes even six and seven are a graph.

01:27.290 --> 01:34.100
But we see here that it's not cyclical a ASAC like because there's no way for me to go back let's say

01:34.100 --> 01:35.320
0 to 1.

01:35.330 --> 01:37.420
I can go back to zero.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.590
All right I lost one.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.350
What about this one.

01:41.210 --> 01:45.340
This is a directed weighted graph.

01:45.380 --> 01:51.890
We have the weights has direction and when it comes to cyclic No there are no cycles.

01:51.890 --> 01:53.680
So it's a cyclic.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.170
All right.

01:54.170 --> 01:58.900
The final challenge what type of graph is this.

02:01.680 --> 02:02.730
Ready for the answer.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.720
This is a directed acyclic graph.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.090
There's no cycles.

02:09.090 --> 02:18.350
It's directed and it's a graph and this directed acyclic graph is quite common in called Dagh.

02:18.360 --> 02:27.330
And actually a project like Iowa which is a pretty popular blogging project uses this and uses fancy

02:27.330 --> 02:29.940
words like directed acyclic graph.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.320
But at the end of the day that's not impressive anymore right.

02:33.330 --> 02:38.510
We know what that is just simply a graph that goes in one direction.

02:38.970 --> 02:42.440
I think it's time for us to learn how to build our own graph.

02:42.780 --> 02:43.980
I'll see in the next one.

02:44.330 --> 02:44.610
But by.
