00:01.490 --> 00:02.590
There we have it.

00:02.780 --> 00:06.490
We've just completed our data structure section.

00:06.710 --> 00:15.380
We went through all these data structures even some sub data structures and you don't want We've completed

00:15.440 --> 00:17.810
a lot of this mind map.

00:18.020 --> 00:21.400
We've talked about arrays.

00:21.770 --> 00:23.750
We've talked about stacks and Qs.

00:23.870 --> 00:31.110
We've talked about hash tables linked lists trees and all the types of trees that we have.

00:31.160 --> 00:37.510
We even talked about graphs all these little boxes that are data structures.

00:37.730 --> 00:41.600
We now have an understanding of what they are and how they're used.

00:42.350 --> 00:48.590
But there's a few other pieces of my map that we need to go through and that is algorithms and you'll

00:48.590 --> 00:53.900
see algorithms depicted here in rocketships.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.890
Our last piece of the puzzle but you might still have a few questions that haven't been answered and

01:01.890 --> 01:09.430
there are some things that I left out because they apply more to algorithms when it comes to sorting.

01:09.450 --> 01:14.920
We're going to use arrays and Treece when it comes to dynamic programming.

01:15.030 --> 01:20.760
We're going to be talking about hash tables when we talk about breadth first search and depth first

01:20.760 --> 01:28.360
search that's used in graphs and trees recursion Well that comes up a lot in trees as well.

01:28.380 --> 01:36.600
So now that we have our fundamentals for data structures we're now ready to talk about these algorithms

01:36.810 --> 01:44.400
that come up a lot in interviews because we now understand how data structures work we're able to talk

01:44.400 --> 01:49.860
about algorithms intelligently and understand them at a fundamental level.

01:49.890 --> 01:51.420
I'll see you in the algorithm section.
