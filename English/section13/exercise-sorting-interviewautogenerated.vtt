Welcome back I hope your brain is non-Bush from all the sorting algorithms.

00:06.760 --> 00:14.320
I know I keep saying this but sorting is one of my least favorite topics because there's just so much

00:14.320 --> 00:14.990
to learn.

00:16.210 --> 00:22.880
And most people focus on just coding sorting algorithms which just doesn't apply in real life.

00:22.900 --> 00:29.820
Most developers and engineers go their entire life not ever coding a sorting algorithm from scratch.

00:30.010 --> 00:35.920
But we are going to encounter situations where we need to make decisions on which sorting algorithm

00:36.070 --> 00:37.630
to use.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.060
So to prepare you for that.

00:39.220 --> 00:41.200
I have a couple of questions.

00:42.730 --> 00:48.520
And the questions are number here and I want you to answer each question.

00:48.520 --> 00:54.460
If this was asked to you by your employer or boss or maybe an interview what type of sorting algorithm

00:54.460 --> 00:57.310
you'd use based on this factor.

00:58.120 --> 01:04.510
For example we have 10 schools around your house and you want to sort them by distance what type of

01:04.510 --> 01:11.880
sorting algorithm will you use and you'll see here we have about 8 questions.

01:11.930 --> 01:12.880
Give it a try.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.330
I'll link to this exercise.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.310
And in the next video I'll give you my opinion.

01:18.550 --> 01:22.230
Remember there's always pros and cons with everything.

01:22.270 --> 01:26.810
So really think about this and I'll see you in the next video.
