Walk them back I want to show you the greatest thing ever in computer science especially when it comes

00:07.160 --> 00:10.070
to algorithms.

00:10.110 --> 00:14.490
I'm going to link to this channel because I just think is the greatest thing ever.

00:14.490 --> 00:20.080
Also the comments are absolutely hilarious if you're nerdy like me.

00:20.340 --> 00:30.510
But somebody created a sort algorithm dance playlist where they take different sorting algorithms and

00:30.510 --> 00:33.540
show them how they work with some traditional music.

00:33.800 --> 00:41.910
Let's say traditional Romanian music traditional Hungarian music traditional Transylvanian Saxon for

00:42.060 --> 00:48.590
dance and they show different sorts so you can check out bubble sort which we've talked about or selection

00:48.590 --> 00:55.010
sort which we're doing right now to help you with your average size and to write your own algorithms

00:55.100 --> 00:56.370
for the exercises.

00:58.130 --> 01:01.340
Not only is the music just absolutely amazing.

01:01.340 --> 01:06.740
It really really helps you with how sorting algorithms work by the way.

01:06.740 --> 01:10.300
My favorite one is the quick of one which we're going to get into.

01:10.340 --> 01:20.660
It's the best dance to see especially if you do it at two speed to speed these dancing has become really

01:20.660 --> 01:23.190
really fun to watch and really help you out.

01:23.280 --> 01:28.820
Anyway it's the little fun thing to do with your exercises when you're trying to figure out how to write

01:28.970 --> 01:31.030
and implement your own sorting algorithms.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.870
I think this is the best way to visualize things to show you how they work.
