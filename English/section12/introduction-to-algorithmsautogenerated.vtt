Welcome to the algorithm's section this is a word that immediately just sounds nice right.

00:10.490 --> 00:15.800
All the companies are using it these days to sound like they're doing something really really important.

00:16.510 --> 00:24.100
Everybody has a secret algorithm that they use to make machine learning models analyze user data make

00:24.160 --> 00:25.780
companies lots of money.

00:26.080 --> 00:35.360
But underneath the hood algorithms are just functions that programmers write a two line function is

00:35.420 --> 00:43.670
technically an algorithm a thousand line algorithm that sorts through images is also an algorithm.

00:43.670 --> 00:51.780
Algorithms are simply steps in a process that we take to perform a desired action with computers.

00:53.450 --> 01:00.310
If we go to Wikipedia and search lists of algorithms the list is pretty endless.

01:00.320 --> 01:05.240
There are a lot of algorithms.

01:05.380 --> 01:07.420
It's impossible to know all of them.

01:07.480 --> 01:14.770
You can create your own algorithms you can use other algorithms that are popular and well established.

01:14.970 --> 01:18.740
But let's get back to our question of what are algorithms.

01:18.900 --> 01:28.220
If we combine our knowledge of data structures the ones that we worked on in the previous sections algorithms

01:28.310 --> 01:36.200
allow us to use language built in data structures like arrays and objects or primitives such as integers

01:36.230 --> 01:43.910
and booleans and even custom datatypes like we did when we use the class keyword to create stacks cue's

01:44.030 --> 01:46.560
binary search trees.

01:46.960 --> 01:54.010
Algorithms allow us to use these data structures to perform actions on that data.

01:54.040 --> 02:00.440
Remember this right data structures and algorithms create programs in this course.

02:00.440 --> 02:07.520
We're going to talk about the most common interview algorithms so that long list on Wikipedia won't

02:07.520 --> 02:12.590
be as intimidating because we're only going to focus on the want that matter especially for interviews

02:12.830 --> 02:19.990
but also the ones that matter most in your career specifically we're going to go over these topics when

02:19.990 --> 02:21.460
it comes to algorithms.

02:21.460 --> 02:28.060
Now why are these algorithms so common in interviews and especially in big companies.

02:28.620 --> 02:34.230
Well you can get away with not knowing these topics for a long time.

02:34.290 --> 02:41.520
As a programmer but as we have learned big-O and scalability of code is important as companies get larger

02:41.520 --> 02:45.290
and larger by learning these listed algorithms.

02:45.480 --> 02:50.550
We're able to do majority of the scaling we need to improve our programs.

02:50.550 --> 03:00.450
Remember our big-O Chichi and how we haven't really talked about oh log and O N log and maybe a little

03:00.450 --> 03:02.040
bit in the previous videos.

03:02.910 --> 03:12.780
CERN algorithms allow us to simplify our big O complexity into smaller or better time complexity.

03:13.710 --> 03:19.740
So that by using the right algorithm I could take a function that has a big show of this notation down

03:19.740 --> 03:28.380
to something of O and log in or something that has a linear time complexity to o log event.

03:28.550 --> 03:35.360
And these are used everywhere in large companies because large companies handle lots of inputs lots

03:35.450 --> 03:36.540
of data.

03:36.590 --> 03:43.670
So this topic is extremely important to them and as your career grows and grows these topics will be

03:43.670 --> 03:46.320
more and more importantly.

03:46.390 --> 03:48.760
So let's dive in to our first topic.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.480
I'll see in the next one.

03:50.690 --> 03:50.950
Babai.
