Walk them back I have a fun little exercise for you.

00:04.970 --> 00:06.390
And now you're asking yourself.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.660
Andrea you say all the exercises are fun.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.750
You are a big liar.

00:10.750 --> 00:11.300
All right.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.000
Fair point but I think this one's going to be fun.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.100
So stick with me.

00:16.020 --> 00:24.390
I want you to write a function actually two functions that finds the factorial of any number.

00:24.470 --> 00:26.030
Now why two functions.

00:26.240 --> 00:34.820
Well one function is going to be recursive using what we just learned where we have to create a base

00:34.820 --> 00:37.030
case we have to follow the steps right.

00:37.100 --> 00:44.030
If we go back we have to identify a base case and a recursive case and then finally make sure that we

00:44.030 --> 00:46.970
were to turn both cases.

00:47.110 --> 00:57.670
So this recursive function is going to return an answer but what is a factorial a good way to think

00:57.670 --> 00:59.510
about factorial.

00:59.620 --> 01:10.030
Is this notation five exclamation mark factorials simply means multiply five times four times three

01:10.150 --> 01:12.280
times two times one.

01:12.490 --> 01:18.540
You keep going down one by one multiplying each number until you get to 1.

01:18.790 --> 01:27.260
So six factorial will be six times five times four times three times to 10 Amazon and you'll notice

01:27.260 --> 01:36.770
here that it's a recursion pattern that we're doing we call the function and we have two cases that

01:36.770 --> 01:37.630
can happen.

01:37.670 --> 01:45.440
We have the base case to stop or recursive case and so on and so forth and we keep going keep going

01:45.440 --> 01:48.840
keep going until we hit 1.

01:48.860 --> 01:52.620
So I want to build a function that does this for us.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.840
I'm going to write the function factorial.

01:56.840 --> 02:01.050
You're going to put in five and it's going to run through this.

02:01.490 --> 02:09.190
But remember our definition of recursion recursion is when you define something in terms of itself.

02:09.210 --> 02:19.490
Now a good way to think about factorial is this five factorial is simply five times four factorial.

02:19.670 --> 02:24.260
You see over here five times four factorial is factorial five

02:27.040 --> 02:34.510
five times four times three factorial four times three is five factorial because four times factorial

02:34.510 --> 02:42.500
three equals factorial for and you see here how we might have a recursion function that we can write

02:43.010 --> 02:45.290
using this knowledge.

02:45.290 --> 02:50.110
See if you can create a function that allows you to do this.

02:50.210 --> 02:54.500
Now when it comes to this question there's two ways that you can go about it.

02:54.560 --> 03:00.950
You can do the recursive approach where the function calls itself or you can do the iterative approach

03:01.010 --> 03:09.470
which means looping and most of you are probably going to find it easier to solve it with this way with

03:09.470 --> 03:11.200
just a for loop.

03:11.270 --> 03:15.840
For example I'm going to leave this up to you to figure out.

03:15.870 --> 03:19.540
See if you can do both functions and see if they give you the right number.

03:20.010 --> 03:23.000
And in the next video I'll show you the answer.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.230
I'll see that one.

03:24.240 --> 03:24.580
Good luck.
