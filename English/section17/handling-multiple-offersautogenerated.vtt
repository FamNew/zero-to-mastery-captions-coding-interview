00:01.850 --> 00:08.930
Handling multiple offers this is a great problem to have if you're able to get multiple offers.

00:09.230 --> 00:11.720
Well then you're definitely doing something right.

00:11.720 --> 00:18.020
This should be your goal your goal going to interviews is not to say I really hope they hire me.

00:18.020 --> 00:19.390
I hope I just get one offer.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.260
Ideally you get multiple offers.

00:21.290 --> 00:26.830
The more choices we have the better we can make a decision on where we should go where we should work.

00:27.180 --> 00:34.340
But first of all congratulations if you got to this point someone find your skills valuable but what

00:34.340 --> 00:36.470
do you do if you have multiple offers.

00:36.470 --> 00:42.610
We know what to do when there is one offer but what if you have two or more companies interested in

00:42.620 --> 00:43.270
you.

00:43.790 --> 00:51.620
You first have to decide which company you want and you're hopefully handling each of these companies

00:52.190 --> 00:57.530
letting them know that the other has made an offer and you have figured out what sort of salary and

00:57.530 --> 00:59.050
benefits that you're going to get.

01:00.040 --> 01:04.160
But salary and benefits aren't the only thing that should matter to you.

01:04.210 --> 01:11.230
And over here I've created a list for you a priority list of what should go into deciding which company

01:11.230 --> 01:12.460
to work for.

01:12.460 --> 01:14.390
Number one being the most important.

01:14.550 --> 01:22.480
And number five being the least important listed in this list this rank of importance and keep in mind

01:22.480 --> 01:29.110
that this is based on individual situations should be a guideline for you to decide what companies should

01:29.110 --> 01:29.800
go with.

01:30.040 --> 01:37.820
The first one is that is there an offer that you feel you're under qualified for is one of the companies

01:38.690 --> 01:47.450
offering your job that you think is way over your head way harder than the skills that you think you

01:47.450 --> 01:47.990
have.

01:48.820 --> 01:52.470
Because if that's the case you should go with that company.

01:52.660 --> 01:56.230
You're not taking a job to do the same thing that you already know what to do.

01:56.260 --> 02:02.020
You're taking a job to grow and learn so that next time you interview next time you're looking for a

02:02.020 --> 02:07.100
job you're even better skilled better prepared more valuable.

02:07.120 --> 02:14.110
So if one of the jobs is way harder than the other then that's a good sign that you should take it because

02:14.110 --> 02:18.210
that's the one that's going to allow you to really push your skills to the next level.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.760
And this relates to the second point.

02:21.760 --> 02:28.100
Long term growth potential between the two offers which one allows you to grow.

02:28.230 --> 02:33.810
This means not just your skills being able to become a better engineer a better programmer developer

02:33.930 --> 02:38.950
whatever it is you're looking for but also is the company growing.

02:38.960 --> 02:45.560
Do you have an ability to perhaps grow into that position and get promoted and in better position better

02:45.560 --> 02:47.840
roles long term growth potential.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.360
Don't just look at the short term here.

02:51.350 --> 02:56.300
So in five years if you start this company five years will you still be doing the same thing.

02:56.390 --> 02:57.250
Hopefully not.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.830
Third is will you respect the people you're working with.

03:02.860 --> 03:07.680
Are you going to be the smartest person in the room or the dumbest person in the room.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.330
Which do you think is best.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.660
If you're the smartest person at a company well you're not growing as much are you.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.630
You're not learning from others.

03:17.760 --> 03:23.730
You may be in charge and that may be good but if you're an engineer developer programmer you're looking

03:23.730 --> 03:25.130
to improve your skills.

03:25.320 --> 03:31.180
If your coworkers people around you are way smarter than you that allows you to really grow and learn.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.040
And that's a really important factor.

03:34.070 --> 03:34.890
The next one.

03:35.150 --> 03:38.070
Yes everybody's favorite salary and benefits.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.570
It's pretty surprising that it's number four right.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.400
But we're thinking long term here.

03:42.410 --> 03:49.830
Salary and benefits aren't as important as the ones on the top in the 1 2 and 3 spot and most people

03:49.830 --> 03:58.440
put this first but there's a classic psychological study where they present a cake to some young kids

03:59.640 --> 04:05.820
and they say that you can have the Schaik now or if you wait 10 minutes you can get two pieces of cake

04:05.850 --> 04:06.640
instead of one.

04:08.090 --> 04:11.770
And they studied media gratification versus long term gratification.

04:12.230 --> 04:19.010
And I don't know how accurate the study is but the point of the study was that the kids who waited for

04:19.130 --> 04:24.160
two pieces of cake instead of just eating the cake right away and now waiting.

04:24.440 --> 04:28.410
The kids who waited were more successful long term throughout their careers.

04:28.460 --> 04:31.200
The idea of delayed gratification.

04:31.210 --> 04:35.570
Now looking at the immediate benefits by looking at long term benefits.

04:35.630 --> 04:39.160
Keep in mind a salary doesn't include just money.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.740
There's also moving expenses.

04:41.960 --> 04:48.420
Bonuses stock options health care and a whole lot of other packages.

04:48.460 --> 04:54.630
So your final decision once and when it comes to salary and benefits is to combine all of those.

04:54.850 --> 05:00.100
Finally the fifth point is is your decision based on desperation.

05:00.460 --> 05:05.830
You've got to remind yourself are you doing this because you think you won't get any other offers like

05:05.830 --> 05:07.090
this.

05:07.330 --> 05:08.360
Because that's not good.

05:08.500 --> 05:14.230
You're most likely won't stay at this company for that long of a time or at least not for your entire

05:14.230 --> 05:14.770
life.

05:15.590 --> 05:21.320
Most likely you'll move on to another company in a few years and go through the interview process all

05:21.320 --> 05:22.210
over again.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.050
So make the decision with that in mind.

05:25.190 --> 05:26.810
Is this company worth it.

05:26.810 --> 05:33.060
Am I just accepting a job because I'm desperate and I think this is the only option am I going to get.

05:33.060 --> 05:38.350
Because if you're going to be in the same position two years from now then that won't really help you

05:38.350 --> 05:38.910
will it.

05:39.770 --> 05:46.850
The final decision when it comes to companies is to think about how this will look in the narrative

05:46.850 --> 05:48.120
of your life.

05:48.170 --> 05:52.470
Will this look good on my resume if it does then you should take that job.

05:53.410 --> 05:59.590
Don't take the job that's the most comfortable the easiest or you're confident that that's the easiest

05:59.950 --> 06:05.470
take the job that will push you and really stretch and grow you in your career and at the end of the

06:05.470 --> 06:08.740
day pick the option that will make you happy.

06:08.950 --> 06:13.820
If you don't enjoy something you probably won't be giving it your all anyway.

06:14.140 --> 06:17.950
If your job gives you purpose and makes you happy that's probably a good sign too.

06:18.830 --> 06:24.940
And then finally when you're rejecting an offer from another company just never burn down bridges.

06:24.950 --> 06:29.630
Be nice to people you never know when this will come back to help you in the future.

06:30.260 --> 06:35.750
I wanted to give you an example of one of my situations when I how multiple offers from each company

06:36.590 --> 06:39.910
I told both companies that I have got an offer.

06:40.070 --> 06:45.860
I actually managed to get one of the companies to give me an offer after the first company sent the

06:45.860 --> 06:47.580
offer and gave me a deadline.

06:47.630 --> 06:52.160
So I did exactly like I said in the previous videos message the other company letting them know that

06:52.370 --> 06:54.590
there was an offer on the table.

06:54.600 --> 07:01.020
I then had both offers from these companies and they actually kept increasing the salary because they

07:01.020 --> 07:04.000
knew that I was wanted by all.

07:04.110 --> 07:10.800
I actually ended up picking the job with a lower salary than the other one because of all these factors

07:10.800 --> 07:15.710
that you see here today and I am here where I am because of that decision.

07:15.990 --> 07:17.410
That wasn't the only decision.

07:17.430 --> 07:21.900
There's going to be many decisions throughout your life but really think about the long term implications

07:22.500 --> 07:26.370
and make sure that you're happy with the decision that you make.

07:26.370 --> 07:27.100
I'll see in the next one.
