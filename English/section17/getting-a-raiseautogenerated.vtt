00:01.080 --> 00:02.030
Walk them back.

00:02.210 --> 00:06.770
Let's talk about another fun topic that is getting a raise.

00:06.860 --> 00:08.700
How do we go about doing this.

00:08.750 --> 00:16.940
Getting a raise is hopefully not that hard because remember if somebody hired you that means they find

00:16.940 --> 00:17.930
you valuable.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.210
But in order to get a raise you have to be a good employee.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.840
If you're a terrible employee you don't do your work on time.

00:25.880 --> 00:30.260
You don't provide good quality work than getting a raise is not realistic.

00:30.260 --> 00:36.020
So the first step is to actually be a good employee and hopefully because you're taking this course

00:36.400 --> 00:43.610
you're the type of person who really values their skills and has a strong self-determined work ethic.

00:43.610 --> 00:49.040
I mean you're teaching yourself how to say interviews you're definitely the type of person who's determined

00:49.040 --> 00:50.060
to succeed.

00:50.540 --> 00:51.560
So that's a good sign.

00:52.790 --> 00:57.500
And when you start a job you want to hit the ground running the better you are the employee the more

00:57.500 --> 01:00.050
likely you are for them to keep you around.

01:00.050 --> 01:06.110
And one thing that I really like to do before you start a job is to plan out your career path ahead

01:06.110 --> 01:09.730
of time at this company before your first day on the job.

01:10.220 --> 01:13.760
And this should be in the back of your mind throughout your career.

01:13.820 --> 01:20.960
This way you have an idea of where you want to be in one two three maybe five years at the company and

01:20.990 --> 01:24.040
you can check up on that to make sure that you don't become complacent.

01:24.050 --> 01:28.700
You don't just stay in the same role and not grow and just become comfortable.

01:29.060 --> 01:31.850
But anyway let's talk about getting a raise.

01:31.880 --> 01:32.830
How do we do it.

01:33.140 --> 01:39.070
Well luckily for you are just two steps that we're going to go over.

01:39.120 --> 01:45.700
First things first is that getting a raise is one of the easiest ways to earn money.

01:45.760 --> 01:52.690
You know how we all try to save money by not buying a coffee buying gasoline for our car when the gas

01:52.690 --> 01:53.530
is cheaper.

01:53.890 --> 01:55.680
But those are really good ways to save money.

01:55.690 --> 02:01.610
But getting a raise and getting paid more is just an easier way for you to have more money.

02:01.660 --> 02:03.740
So it's a very very important thing.

02:03.760 --> 02:08.400
The first step that we want to do is to actually ask for a raise.

02:08.500 --> 02:15.130
I know it's a silly point to have but you have no idea how many times people say oh my company doesn't

02:15.130 --> 02:20.670
really do raises or people thinking that by asking for a raise they're considered rude and they're going

02:20.670 --> 02:21.500
to get fired.

02:22.430 --> 02:30.350
Especially as an engineer at the end of the day you will get a raise if you provide value to the company.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.820
If you never ask the answer is always no.

02:33.830 --> 02:42.020
For example $10000 means a lot more to you than it does to a company because well they have a lot more

02:42.020 --> 02:42.690
money than you.

02:42.800 --> 02:49.450
So think about it this way if you owned a business and you had an employee that is fantastic.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.270
Great.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.700
Would you pay them $10000 more on top of their salary just out of the kindness of your heart.

02:57.720 --> 03:02.190
I mean you might but most likely you're not going to unless they ask.

03:02.190 --> 03:05.010
But if they ask you value them right.

03:05.010 --> 03:10.980
Finding a new employee to do the work to train them and hopefully be as good as you are is going to

03:10.980 --> 03:13.310
cost your business a lot of money.

03:13.410 --> 03:19.470
You're not going to say no to a let's say 10 percent increase in their salary because it means a lot

03:19.470 --> 03:20.050
less to you.

03:20.130 --> 03:25.140
So keep that in mind for companies hiring and training people is really expensive.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.090
They rather keep the good employees that they have.

03:28.140 --> 03:29.770
It's a lot cheaper to do so.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.280
So always ask for a raise.

03:33.320 --> 03:39.450
All companies if you provide enough value should have the capacity to give you raises.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.930
But here's the thing.

03:41.030 --> 03:45.570
And this is the second part you have to show don't tell.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.930
You can't just say I'm valuable.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.670
Can I have more money.

03:49.880 --> 03:53.210
You actually want to show them why you're valuable.

03:53.210 --> 03:54.530
Let me explain.

03:54.710 --> 03:58.350
When asking for a raise you don't just go in and ask for it.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.910
You want to make a presentation.

03:59.930 --> 04:08.660
Maybe a one page summary document perhaps or an evil to your boss offering proof that you're driving

04:09.080 --> 04:11.980
the metrics the numbers that matter to them.

04:12.290 --> 04:18.200
This way you show your great investment and you show the numbers the stories the reason why you should

04:18.200 --> 04:18.690
get a raise.

04:18.710 --> 04:23.750
If you don't have a reason and you just want to raise it you just say that it doesn't make sense.

04:23.750 --> 04:31.370
So hopefully you're a good employee a good engineer and you're contributing to the company and at the

04:31.370 --> 04:34.460
end of the day there's no easy way around it.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.730
Well you're going to do it during your first months at the job.

04:39.650 --> 04:45.140
I would personally keep a folder with all the good things you have done for the company and this is

04:45.140 --> 04:46.820
something that I've done myself as well.

04:47.970 --> 04:54.030
Problems you have solved money you've saved great comments or feedback I've gotten from clients and

04:54.030 --> 05:01.350
coworkers e-mails and perhaps keep track of your skill level from the first day on the job to the six

05:01.350 --> 05:02.010
months mark.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.350
What did you learn what did you improve on.

05:04.350 --> 05:11.020
List all these skills you have acquired and list what you plan to accomplish in the next six months.

05:11.010 --> 05:15.480
Write this all out in a document by writing a one page letter showing.

05:15.480 --> 05:21.870
Example of this proof of how good of an employee you are why you've learned why your plans are for the

05:21.870 --> 05:24.780
next six months to improve the company.

05:24.810 --> 05:30.240
Now you have a way to meet with the person in charge of making the salary decision and actually give

05:30.240 --> 05:36.540
them this piece of document that shows why you deserve a higher salary why you're a different person

05:36.540 --> 05:42.170
than you were when they first hired you when they didn't know that you were going to be valuable.

05:42.200 --> 05:47.950
And finally you want to ask for a salary level a lot higher than you actually want.

05:47.990 --> 05:56.800
So a good general rule is 10000 more than you actually want because most likely they're going to meet

05:56.800 --> 05:57.580
you in the middle.

05:57.670 --> 06:01.810
And this will make the middle the happy ground for both parties.

06:03.050 --> 06:03.780
OK.

06:03.870 --> 06:05.310
And I know what you're thinking.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.240
It's not going to work.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.660
Andre may have work for you but not not for me.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.850
And this sounds very blunt.

06:11.850 --> 06:15.930
Some people are worried about asking raises and it's an uncomfortable situation.

06:16.050 --> 06:23.370
But let me ask you this if both employer and employee respect each other value each other shouldn't

06:23.370 --> 06:28.470
this be normal to find a middle ground where both parties are happy.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.370
After all look at all the good that you have done for them.

06:31.770 --> 06:36.660
Like I said before it's very expensive for companies to hire new developers new engineers.

06:36.810 --> 06:38.840
You're already established yourself.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.140
You've proven yourself and you've done a great job with the company.

06:42.210 --> 06:46.450
They want to keep your value yourself because they value you.

06:47.300 --> 06:52.820
To finish off I just want to give an example of a little story of how I managed to get raises on my

06:52.820 --> 06:53.510
previous job.

06:53.510 --> 06:59.170
I got a raise every six months and it wasn't because they just gave it to me.

06:59.250 --> 07:05.600
It's because I asked for a raise every six months and every six months I received a race.

07:05.800 --> 07:13.300
As a matter of fact one time I got a raise that while I wasn't happy with and I said Why I thought it

07:13.300 --> 07:14.060
should be more.

07:14.470 --> 07:19.410
And they actually agreed and came back and gave me an even higher raise.

07:19.510 --> 07:26.690
And that story is not just for me to boast and show off but to show you that it's possible.

07:26.740 --> 07:29.110
You have to ask if you never ask.

07:29.110 --> 07:30.780
The answer is always no.

07:30.940 --> 07:36.180
Show why you deserve the raise and you'll be surprised at how easy it is to do so.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.040
I hope this was helpful and I'll see in the next video.

07:40.320 --> 07:40.550
Buh-Bye.
