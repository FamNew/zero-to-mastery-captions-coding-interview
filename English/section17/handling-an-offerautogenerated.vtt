00:01.310 --> 00:06.560
Congratulations you just received an offer from a company you should be proud of yourself.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.090
Pay yourself on the back.

00:08.090 --> 00:12.420
Take a couple breaths and now let's talk about what you should do next.

00:13.300 --> 00:14.750
You just received an offer.

00:14.950 --> 00:20.110
What is your response going to be if you say yep this sounds great.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.250
Let's do it.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.070
You just ended the conversation.

00:24.070 --> 00:29.790
You just accepted and you've closed the door on any sort of negotiation.

00:30.180 --> 00:30.870
That's it.

00:30.880 --> 00:36.040
As a recruiter or an interviewer their job is done.

00:36.220 --> 00:40.580
They hired you but is there a better way.

00:40.590 --> 00:44.220
Remember we don't want to end the conversation here.

00:44.310 --> 00:47.720
Instead you might want to say something along the lines of this.

00:47.870 --> 00:49.250
This sounds fantastic.

00:49.470 --> 00:52.070
I really thought this was a great fit.

00:52.080 --> 00:58.950
When I met you and I interviewed you and I'm really glad to see that we both agree and you see a good

00:58.950 --> 01:06.380
fit here right now I'm talking to a few other companies so I can't really speak to the full details

01:06.500 --> 01:10.240
of the offer until I'm done with the interviewing process.

01:11.110 --> 01:17.010
And I'm closer to making a decision but I'm sure that we can find something that works great for us

01:17.020 --> 01:21.220
because I would really love to be part of your team and I had a great time interviewing and I could

01:21.220 --> 01:23.620
really see myself working there long term.

01:24.670 --> 01:25.700
You see what I did there.

01:25.960 --> 01:33.850
I kept the conversation going and I let them know that I may at other companies but I didn't seem very

01:33.850 --> 01:34.450
greedy.

01:34.450 --> 01:40.690
I instead said that I would love to work from them but I want to make sure that I make the right decision

01:41.080 --> 01:43.350
based on the offers that I get.

01:43.460 --> 01:49.150
Remember I was very positive you want to be positive when handling an offer you don't want to seem greedy

01:49.150 --> 01:57.460
or that you're just shopping around and ideally when you receive an offer the first thing that you should

01:57.460 --> 02:02.150
try and do is to ask for more time to make your decision.

02:03.210 --> 02:09.120
Especially if this is your first offer because ideally you're not just into being a one company you're

02:09.120 --> 02:11.130
interviewing at multiple companies.

02:11.190 --> 02:17.310
And ideally if you're a well-prepared like you have been in this course then you're going to have a

02:17.310 --> 02:19.030
few more offers come again.

02:19.380 --> 02:23.070
So time is the most valuable thing you can ask for here.

02:23.220 --> 02:28.800
The more time you have the more time you have to have offers from different companies so you can make

02:28.800 --> 02:34.650
the right decision and pick the one or the company that has the best package for you.

02:35.730 --> 02:42.750
Now you just received an offer you just told then that you're very excited and you're waiting around

02:42.750 --> 02:50.320
for a few more things and you also ask for time and you have an idea of when they want to give you a

02:50.320 --> 02:51.540
response.

02:51.600 --> 02:59.370
The next thing you want to do is after you received the offer to let the other companies know again

02:59.520 --> 03:05.630
if you're already intervening at other companies you now have a very powerful tool.

03:06.550 --> 03:11.860
You have stakes you should be reaching out to all these companies that you haven't received an offer

03:11.860 --> 03:19.120
from to let them know that you've just received an offer and you want to build a sense of urgency here

03:19.310 --> 03:24.530
as if you have a timeline a deadline where you have to say yes or no to an offer.

03:24.530 --> 03:28.160
So you would like to hear from these other companies as well.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.800
And this is a classic psychological technique.

03:31.850 --> 03:38.540
Remember your brain now and the best part of interview where the ball is in your court and you get to

03:38.540 --> 03:41.060
decide what company you want to work for.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.950
So you can actually send out an e-mail like this to the other companies.

03:45.950 --> 03:46.550
Hello.

03:46.550 --> 03:48.590
Name of company or person.

03:48.770 --> 03:52.730
I just want to let you know and give you an update on my interviewing process.

03:52.790 --> 03:56.050
I've just received an offer from another company.

03:56.150 --> 03:59.620
You can get the company name which is quite strong.

04:00.620 --> 04:04.610
With that said I'm really excited to potentially be working with your company.

04:04.610 --> 04:12.020
I had a really good time interviewing with you and I really wanted to see if we can make things work.

04:12.260 --> 04:18.800
Since my timeline is now a little bit compressed with this new offer is there anything we can do to

04:18.800 --> 04:21.120
make the process go a little bit faster.

04:22.090 --> 04:22.710
And that's it.

04:23.670 --> 04:27.300
You've just let the other companies know that there's an other offer.

04:27.300 --> 04:32.150
The other companies know that you're wanted and you're needed somewhere else.

04:32.160 --> 04:37.740
This creates a lot of social proof and also creates urgency to psychological techniques that really

04:37.740 --> 04:39.530
really help in negotiation.

04:39.900 --> 04:45.080
You now have stakes you have to realize what a company's goals are.

04:45.240 --> 04:51.630
A company's goal is to hire someone who will become an effective employee and produce more value than

04:51.660 --> 04:53.510
the salary that they're paying them.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.370
What's going to cost to hire you.

04:56.580 --> 05:02.310
Companies try their best to figure out which candidates can produce that value.

05:02.310 --> 05:08.220
It's a risky business right and it's impossible to know for certain until they start working in the

05:08.220 --> 05:11.160
company and start producing results.

05:11.190 --> 05:13.990
But there are a few ways of companies finding out.

05:14.040 --> 05:18.860
That's what they interview for that's why they have coding challenges or coding interviews.

05:19.140 --> 05:22.910
And another one is to see if somebody else wants them.

05:23.040 --> 05:28.260
If another company wants you that means you succeeded through their interviewing process.

05:28.320 --> 05:34.230
When you're interviewing at big companies and you have an offer from a big company or a competitor let's

05:34.230 --> 05:40.230
say you're interviewing at Microsoft and Google just made you an offer you should definitely mention

05:40.230 --> 05:46.140
that even the company name to Google so that they know you're wanted.

05:46.140 --> 05:49.520
That creates a lot of social proof.

05:49.570 --> 05:55.510
So remember no matter how useless or pointless you think this e-mail to other companies maybe you want

05:55.510 --> 06:01.020
to send this signal to everybody letting them know that a company wants you.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.560
It's a huge powerful negotiation tool.

06:04.630 --> 06:10.460
Finally always know when the deadline is to respond to an offer.

06:11.270 --> 06:18.170
Be honest with them and tell them that you're waiting on other offers from other companies and you want

06:18.170 --> 06:20.330
to make sure that you make the right decision.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.660
They may want to try and rush you and tell them that you have to give them an answer by tomorrow.

06:25.610 --> 06:31.310
And we have to ask yourself is that the type of place you want to work they should respect your time.

06:31.310 --> 06:34.880
And if fact that you are trying to figure out the best option.

06:35.660 --> 06:40.510
When you're declining an offer be polite and don't burn any bridges.

06:40.520 --> 06:47.600
Don't be mean because you never know when you might see them down the road or the person who is their

06:47.600 --> 06:48.400
recruiter there.

06:48.440 --> 06:54.170
My move to a different company and you never know when good relationships might take you further along

06:54.290 --> 06:55.200
down your career.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.770
So let's go over a few things.

06:57.820 --> 06:59.160
What should you do.

06:59.230 --> 07:05.620
The first thing is when you receive an offer you should know exactly what salary you want.

07:05.620 --> 07:10.460
You have to go in there knowing why your value is why you're willing to get paid.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.630
You need to make sure that you do your research on the average industry pay.

07:14.650 --> 07:20.410
You want to make sure that you're getting paid what the average professional and your industry is getting

07:20.410 --> 07:22.740
paid or above.

07:22.770 --> 07:29.250
So you want to do your research and use Web sites like salary dot com Glassdoor dot com payscale dot

07:29.250 --> 07:36.150
com or just simply google it and leave resources for you to find this out after this video.

07:36.220 --> 07:41.900
The next what value do provide you know what type of salary you want.

07:41.900 --> 07:46.180
But really ask this question and be able to answer yourself.

07:46.310 --> 07:49.130
What value are I going to provide for the company.

07:49.190 --> 07:51.380
What would you improve in the company.

07:51.380 --> 07:55.670
What type of traits do you have that make you a valuable hire.

07:55.670 --> 08:00.200
Think about how the company is going to drive value from you.

08:00.470 --> 08:08.250
And by doing this research before hand you're able to use this when negotiating your salary and you

08:08.250 --> 08:16.230
can mention how you would provide value and why you deserve perhaps a higher salary or a higher offer

08:16.230 --> 08:18.700
than they are currently given.

08:18.720 --> 08:26.640
And then finally you want to always go higher then why you wish to get because most likely they're not

08:26.640 --> 08:33.090
going to agree with your initial demands and you want to meet somewhere in the middle where both parties

08:33.090 --> 08:35.600
feel like they have a win win situation.

08:35.610 --> 08:40.260
So if you know your salary you know what value you're going to provide to the company.

08:40.260 --> 08:47.640
Then when perhaps talking about an offer go into that negotiation and make sure that your initial start

08:47.700 --> 08:51.430
is higher then where you might land.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.920
That's it for now.

08:52.920 --> 08:59.190
Let's talk about an even more exciting topic in the next video which is what to do if you're lucky enough

08:59.190 --> 09:00.950
to get multiple offers.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.500
I'll see in the next one.

09:02.700 --> 09:02.800
Bob.
