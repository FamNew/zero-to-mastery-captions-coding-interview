Welcome to the best part of landing a job you've done all the coding exercises you can do.

00:09.380 --> 00:14.960
You've prepared for the interview you've done they interview you you've answered all the questions and

00:14.960 --> 00:19.940
now you wait and hopefully you hear back with good news.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.630
But the game doesn't really end there as a matter of fact.

00:23.650 --> 00:24.640
This is the fun part.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.820
This is what you work for.

00:27.130 --> 00:33.730
And there's an easy obvious way of going about it which is not practicing and not learning how to handle

00:33.730 --> 00:40.570
offers or negotiation or a bit of a harder way where we learn how to do these things properly so that

00:40.900 --> 00:47.440
overall we're able to have higher salaries work for better companies and just overall be more satisfied

00:47.440 --> 00:48.660
with our jobs.

00:48.700 --> 00:54.490
So we're going to take some time in this section to learn the skills that again will allow you to grow

00:54.940 --> 00:57.700
a lot faster and be more satisfied with your jobs.

00:58.030 --> 01:02.180
Let's have a look at where we're going to talk about in this section.

01:02.180 --> 01:08.060
We're going to talk about how to handle an offer when after they interview somebody says hey congratulations.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.510
We want to work with you.

01:09.560 --> 01:10.790
Here is your offer.

01:10.820 --> 01:11.720
What do you do.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.220
Do you just say yes.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.610
What about handling multiple offers.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.470
A lot of people don't talk about this but when you are interviewing Most likely you're interviewing

01:21.500 --> 01:26.720
at a lot of companies and most of the time you're not just getting one offer you're getting multiple

01:26.720 --> 01:27.610
ones.

01:27.620 --> 01:34.740
How does this work and how can you actually use them to improve the actual offers that you get.

01:35.630 --> 01:38.900
We're going to talk about an important topic of handling rejection.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.120
We're all going to get rejected one day.

01:41.120 --> 01:46.720
I don't think I've ever met anybody who's been accepted to every single job that they've applied for.

01:46.730 --> 01:52.240
We're going to talk about getting a raise and how it's actually a lot simpler than you might think.

01:52.310 --> 01:57.410
And obviously we're going to be talking about negotiation and some of the negotiation tactics and techniques

01:57.770 --> 02:04.400
that is going to help you through all these other videos and other lessons to prepare you for the real

02:04.400 --> 02:05.450
world.

02:05.450 --> 02:07.140
So lots to cover.

02:07.310 --> 02:08.710
It's going to be a fun one.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.560
Let's get started.
