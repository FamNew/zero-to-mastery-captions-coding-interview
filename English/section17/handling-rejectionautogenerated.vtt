00:01.890 --> 00:11.610
Even the greatest of engineers sometimes get rejected just like in dating sometimes two of the greatest

00:11.850 --> 00:16.740
people in the world may not be the right fit for each other.

00:16.740 --> 00:24.920
Rejections don't really mean anything especially when it comes to interview because nobody really cares

00:24.920 --> 00:32.030
about the rejection doesn't go on your resume it doesn't go in your LinkedIn profile it just disappears.

00:32.030 --> 00:40.230
Once you get rejected you see winners and people that are good at interviewing just get up after rejection

00:40.770 --> 00:43.320
and go on and keep swinging.

00:43.330 --> 00:44.980
Musing a baseball reference here.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.650
I hope people understand.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.030
So here's the fun fact.

00:49.210 --> 00:53.750
I myself got rejected from numerous jobs.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.450
Does that make me a bad coder.

00:55.460 --> 00:57.560
Does that make me a bad employee.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.490
I mean maybe.

00:59.690 --> 01:03.000
But it also means that it wasn't the right fit for one another.

01:03.080 --> 01:10.160
It's probably good that they rejected me because I probably wouldn't have enjoyed working for them or

01:10.490 --> 01:15.450
I wouldn't have gone the jobs that I had if I wasn't rejected by the previous ones.

01:15.620 --> 01:21.190
You see rejections are never a predictor of success.

01:21.190 --> 01:30.810
Ninety nine rejections and one offer is better than two rejections and no offer.

01:30.920 --> 01:34.210
So it's all a statistic game.

01:34.240 --> 01:41.410
All you need to do is go out and bat go swing get interviews and no matter how many times you are rejected

01:41.500 --> 01:43.110
all you need is that one.

01:43.340 --> 01:45.650
And if you get more than one that's just a bonus.

01:46.700 --> 01:52.670
So when you get rejected see if he can extract as much information or feedback as possible from the

01:52.670 --> 01:53.730
company.

01:54.020 --> 01:58.700
Tell them that you're constantly looking to improve and that you love some feedback.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.510
I mean they already rejected you what's the harm in asking.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.300
Might as well get some information out of it.

02:04.160 --> 02:09.200
And then finally ask them when it would be OK to reapply.

02:09.380 --> 02:16.500
If you're still interested down the road you see I know a few people who have been rejected by numerous

02:16.500 --> 02:21.810
companies and they just kept applying and eventually got hired.

02:22.570 --> 02:26.540
I actually know a person working at Google who did exactly that.

02:26.560 --> 02:30.660
So don't burn any bridges just ask them when you can apply again.

02:30.840 --> 02:31.670
Just remember.

02:31.680 --> 02:38.520
Think about how much of our life we actually spend searching for jobs versus actually working.

02:38.580 --> 02:44.490
We actually don't spend a lot of time in our overall life applying to jobs interview.

02:44.670 --> 02:47.100
So if you look at the grand scheme of things.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.990
Don't be disappointed if you don't get hired within a week.

02:51.060 --> 02:55.230
You should spend time looking for jobs and opportunities because most likely you're going to be there

02:55.230 --> 02:56.320
for a long time.

02:57.470 --> 02:58.690
So you want to make it.

02:59.150 --> 03:06.350
You also can't say that you're on hireable and get depressed or sad because you had a few rejections.

03:07.350 --> 03:10.140
Sometimes luck just plays a role in an interview.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.250
So just don't take it personally.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.000
It's OK to fail.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.160
I failed multiple times.

03:17.220 --> 03:19.220
Everybody fails.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.540
Sometimes you just have a bad day.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.100
It's not the end of the world.

03:23.210 --> 03:29.510
If you fail right for companies for example they're more likely to say no than say yes because it is

03:29.510 --> 03:35.510
a big risk for them to hire somebody you're going to start getting doubts in your mind about your abilities

03:35.540 --> 03:37.280
and your skills.

03:37.280 --> 03:46.950
With all these rejections However like I said before if he failed 10 times try ten times more.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.300
All you need is that one success.

03:50.470 --> 03:57.400
I promise you that if each day you're learning you're getting better and better your skills are improving.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.370
Then one day you will get that offer.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.380
Most people just don't go out and keep shouting.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.310
I'll see in the next video.
