00:01.260 --> 00:04.220
Let's talk about negotiating now.

00:04.270 --> 00:08.980
First off I am no expert in negotiating or tactics.

00:08.980 --> 00:10.920
There are people who are better than me.

00:11.140 --> 00:15.670
And there's a lot of cultural standards and norms that may apply.

00:15.880 --> 00:22.300
So I'm going to tell you what has worked for me and also what I have seen work for others.

00:22.300 --> 00:26.830
Underneath it all there are some few basic principles that can be applied.

00:27.070 --> 00:34.390
And this common theme and common tactics is something that will help you as well but keep that in mind.

00:34.390 --> 00:36.280
Cultures do play a big role here.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.010
All right let's get started.

00:39.310 --> 00:44.730
If you we're asked What salary do you want in an interview what do you say.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.470
Think about this for a second you can pause the video.

00:48.530 --> 00:53.280
What will be your answer when somebody asks you What are your salary expectations.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.760
All right you thought about it.

00:54.860 --> 00:56.140
This is what I would say.

00:56.450 --> 01:01.080
Well I know that the average software developer in Silicon Valley.

01:01.130 --> 01:06.560
Let's say I'm applying there makes roughly a hundred and twenty thousand a year.

01:06.590 --> 01:09.500
So I think that's a good place for us to start.

01:09.510 --> 01:10.430
That was it.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.520
That's what I would say.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.740
Now why is that.

01:14.820 --> 01:18.610
And this goes to my very first point.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.260
You don't want to end the conversation.

01:21.260 --> 01:22.410
You see what I did here.

01:22.510 --> 01:28.650
I didn't actually answer their question and say well I want 90000 per year.

01:28.670 --> 01:36.200
All I did was do something called anchoring where I tell them this is where we want our conversation

01:36.200 --> 01:37.280
to start.

01:37.730 --> 01:43.700
I want the conversation to start around the number 130000 a year and I'm not saying that this is what

01:43.700 --> 01:50.100
I want to get paid this is just simply me starting our conversation so that we can talk about things.

01:50.210 --> 01:56.440
All I said was the average software engineer in negotiation especially when it comes to salary negotiation

01:56.870 --> 02:00.840
you're going to want to give an actual number to end the conversation.

02:02.290 --> 02:09.370
Instead you want to keep the conversation going by giving something like an industry average and make

02:09.370 --> 02:14.670
it clear that you're merely starting the negotiation here and not ending it.

02:14.980 --> 02:17.590
And that's how we start negotiating.

02:17.590 --> 02:24.550
Let's talk about the next point we want to give a reason for everything because we all know the problem

02:24.550 --> 02:26.800
with negotiating right.

02:26.890 --> 02:33.010
If you say you want more salary or more vacation time we kind of sound greedy.

02:33.040 --> 02:39.400
We don't want to sound greedy and we're money hungry and that all we do is care about these numbers

02:39.430 --> 02:43.680
and ourselves as we know nobody really likes greedy people right.

02:43.690 --> 02:46.150
As a matter of fact this is the main reason people don't negotiate.

02:46.150 --> 02:50.760
They just don't want to offend people and seem mean and hungry just for money.

02:50.830 --> 02:54.030
Instead you want to give a reason for everything.

02:54.040 --> 02:58.810
For example if somebody gives you an offer and this is something that will talk and lead on videos and

02:58.810 --> 03:04.920
says hey we are going to offer you $80000 a year what do you think.

03:05.010 --> 03:11.650
Are you in or are you at instead of saying well no I need more time.

03:11.790 --> 03:15.030
Maybe you could say something along the lines of.

03:15.050 --> 03:16.620
Well thank you very much for this offer.

03:16.620 --> 03:19.670
It's very generous and I'm very excited.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.280
Potentially working with your company.

03:21.360 --> 03:27.260
However this is a big family decision and I'm looking to work at a company for many years.

03:27.390 --> 03:33.990
So I would like to discuss this with my wife or my partner and have some time to make sure that there's

03:34.010 --> 03:36.210
something we are both comfortable with.

03:37.180 --> 03:38.480
And you see what I did here.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.620
I just asked for more time or to not give an answer right away.

03:42.760 --> 03:50.080
Perhaps over the phone and instead speak to my partner and all I did was give a reason why I'm doing

03:50.080 --> 03:55.770
things I'm not being selfish I don't want more time just strictly for myself.

03:55.840 --> 04:02.640
This is something that I'm doing because I have somebody else that is involved in the decision.

04:02.740 --> 04:06.600
And by giving a reason like that as an interviewer that makes sense right.

04:06.610 --> 04:10.510
I mean the interviewer will be doing the same in your shoes.

04:11.130 --> 04:12.600
Let's talk about the next point.

04:13.320 --> 04:18.100
Always negotiate I cannot emphasize this enough.

04:18.200 --> 04:24.000
See negotiation is is quite difficult and it is uncomfortable for most people.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.780
Actually I've never met somebody that just loves negotiating maybe one or two but negotiating is very

04:30.780 --> 04:37.950
tricky because it is very different between social dynamics and cultures and demographics appropriate

04:37.950 --> 04:44.400
advice for somebody in North America who's a white male maybe different than somebody in a completely

04:44.730 --> 04:46.080
different location.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.580
There are so many factors at play here.

04:48.750 --> 04:56.640
And you know your culture best but at the same time don't use that as a reason to not negotiate being

04:56.640 --> 05:02.280
able to negotiate is present in all cultures and you got to keep that in mind.

05:02.280 --> 05:11.110
You're never going to damage your relationship or have an offer revoked just by negotiating.

05:11.130 --> 05:16.350
I've never heard of anybody doing that or a company saying no no no we're taking the offer off the table

05:16.350 --> 05:21.010
because you're negotiating to always negotiate if you never ask.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.430
The answer is always no.

05:23.520 --> 05:28.750
And the larger the company usually the more room they have to negotiate.

05:28.830 --> 05:36.660
I actually have a friend who works at a company where the same two Albers that had the same job description

05:36.690 --> 05:45.810
the same responsibilities have a difference of $60000 salary difference one negotiated when they got

05:45.810 --> 05:46.380
hired.

05:46.380 --> 05:52.780
The other one did and the other one is going to get raises and is going to increase but it's going to

05:52.780 --> 05:57.450
take a lot longer for them to make up that $60000 difference.

05:57.470 --> 06:01.700
Another point and this is a very important one is be positive.

06:01.760 --> 06:06.900
You have to realize that negotiating doesn't mean being mean.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.490
It's the exact opposite.

06:08.540 --> 06:16.850
You want to explore the situations that are available to you and negotiations are a win win situation.

06:16.910 --> 06:21.410
If you go into a negotiation thinking that you have to screw over the other person or there's always

06:21.410 --> 06:26.850
one person that went to one person that loses that's not a good way to negotiate.

06:27.960 --> 06:36.270
Negotiation is finding a balance between what two people what and then finally when negotiating you

06:36.270 --> 06:39.610
have to have stakes What does that mean.

06:39.720 --> 06:46.380
No that doesn't mean delicious meat steaks means you have to have something on the line.

06:46.380 --> 06:53.360
If there's no risk and you knew for sure that the other side would sign a contract or accept the salary.

06:53.700 --> 07:00.300
Then what incentive did they have to offer you more if they know that you're desperate and this is the

07:00.300 --> 07:06.050
only job that you can get while there's zero chance of you negotiating with them.

07:06.120 --> 07:13.270
Your alternatives is what stakes are by showing companies that you have other options.

07:13.270 --> 07:17.600
Maybe you have multiple offers or another company that wants to hire you.

07:17.650 --> 07:23.650
You allow the person across the table who's negotiating with you to know that you're willing to walk

07:23.650 --> 07:25.750
away from the table without a deal.

07:26.050 --> 07:29.600
And that gives you a lot of power.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.740
So the best thing to allow you to negotiate is to have other options.

07:33.830 --> 07:40.550
You see recruiters are always willing to negotiate if they want you especially when they have a chance

07:40.550 --> 07:41.450
to lose you.

07:41.510 --> 07:47.230
Nothing makes a recruiter more angry or nervous than losing to a competitor company.

07:47.330 --> 07:54.080
And that's why you'll see people that have job offers from a big company like Amazon or Google that

07:54.080 --> 07:59.690
are able to get hired really easily at other companies like Microsoft because those companies are competing

07:59.690 --> 08:02.980
with each other for some of the top developers or engineers.

08:03.020 --> 08:07.160
And if one wants a candidate it means it's good enough for the other.

08:08.240 --> 08:14.420
And before I finish this video I want to give another example of something that happened to me.

08:14.420 --> 08:20.070
I once got contacted by a book publisher and they wanted me to co-author a book.

08:20.360 --> 08:27.920
And initially they offered to pay a certain amount upfront before the book to publish and then I would

08:27.920 --> 08:33.440
get a percentage of royalties instead of just accepting the offer.

08:33.440 --> 08:40.650
I messaged back and said that I'm very thankful for the opportunity and it sounds fantastic.

08:40.670 --> 08:47.570
However based on the scope of time and research that will take to write this book I would like to discuss

08:47.840 --> 08:50.250
a higher upfront payment.

08:50.270 --> 08:52.180
I was very positive.

08:52.250 --> 08:57.830
I also told them that my time is valuable so I showed them States that this is something that if I do

08:57.830 --> 09:04.930
it it will take away from my other project I negotiated by telling them that I would like to ask for

09:04.930 --> 09:05.950
more.

09:05.950 --> 09:12.010
I gave a reason to the fact of why it deserves more upfront payment.

09:13.060 --> 09:14.720
And I kept the conversation going.

09:15.100 --> 09:22.090
And because of that they came back with a higher upfront payment just by sending one email.

09:22.600 --> 09:29.980
But now let's talk about more detail things such as handling offers and getting raises using these techniques

09:29.980 --> 09:30.900
that we discussed.

09:30.940 --> 09:37.490
We're going to go into the next couple of videos and see how we can apply this to real life situations.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.300
I'll see in that one.
