Well done you just finished another section and congratulations.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.030
Someone find your skills valuable and this is the fun part right.

00:13.140 --> 00:16.020
Offer offers in negotiations.

00:16.110 --> 00:19.200
Being able to handle those properly.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.300
It's something that most people don't really think about because they're so focused on getting a job

00:25.080 --> 00:32.090
that when they actually receive an offer or they're on the job they're not really prepared to handle

00:32.090 --> 00:39.170
negotiation handle salaries handle offers which let's be honest you get these throughout your life throughout

00:39.170 --> 00:39.790
your career.

00:39.830 --> 00:42.070
You're going to have to handle these situations.

00:42.380 --> 00:48.650
And it's one of the best things you can do in terms of investment is being prepared for these.

00:48.680 --> 00:55.520
So I hope the section taught you how to handle rejection how to handle offers how to handle multiple

00:55.520 --> 01:04.180
offers some basic tips on negotiation and how to get a raise and ask for a raise at the end of the day.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.510
We worked so hard to get here.

01:06.770 --> 01:14.710
The easiest part is this where we're able to set ourselves up for the rest of the year.

01:14.750 --> 01:21.530
The rest of our career at our company in a way that we're happy and satisfied with our job with our

01:21.530 --> 01:30.710
salaries and with our benefit there's one overall theme in all of this and that is you want to treat

01:30.710 --> 01:34.350
people well you don't want to create enemies.

01:34.550 --> 01:37.820
And if you do it properly you won't be a nice person.

01:37.820 --> 01:38.960
Be positive.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.650
Don't burn bridges.

01:40.730 --> 01:47.810
Negotiation and asking for salary isn't going to create enemies is just two parties having a conversation

01:48.200 --> 01:51.570
to meet in the middle and both be happy.

01:52.560 --> 01:59.490
And just like a muscle just like we train our coding skills practicing negotiating practicing how to

01:59.490 --> 02:07.100
handle offers is a muscle that you can train so go out there and negotiate your next race.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.880
I'll see you in the next one.

02:08.890 --> 02:09.040
Paba.
