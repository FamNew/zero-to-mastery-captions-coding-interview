Welcome back.

00:02.320 --> 00:09.440
Now in the previous exercise and the exercise we just did we see that we had to do a bit of calculation

00:09.450 --> 00:16.800
it was kind of annoying where we had to add things up then have this you know plus five and plus four

00:17.040 --> 00:22.380
in interviews you're never going to do this and you're asking yourself Andre Why did you just teach

00:22.380 --> 00:23.760
me this and you're right.

00:23.760 --> 00:28.160
But now when you least understand how big O gets calculated.

00:28.590 --> 00:34.650
But most of the time when you go into interviews there's the set of rules that you're going to follow

00:35.220 --> 00:40.680
where you don't need to do this and you can just take a look at this function and immediately say what

00:40.680 --> 00:42.730
type of bego it is.

00:42.870 --> 00:53.650
For example this function actually just turns into a row of an this function again turns into just 0

00:53.920 --> 00:57.610
of an and this is a nifty little trick.

00:57.900 --> 01:05.460
When we talk about big-O in interviews most of the time you're only going to give one of these answers

01:06.890 --> 01:14.420
you're most likely never going to actually calculate precisely 0 3 and or of three and plus two plus

01:14.480 --> 01:15.470
one.

01:15.470 --> 01:20.750
So how was I able to simplify our exercises and just say that they're in.

01:21.190 --> 01:27.770
And luckily for you there are just several rules that we can follow when it comes to the go.

01:28.190 --> 01:29.630
And there's only four of them.

01:30.390 --> 01:36.060
By following these four rules instead of doing those small little calculations we've been doing up until

01:36.060 --> 01:42.790
this moment you can just simplify your life so that big old becomes really really easy to calculate.

01:43.170 --> 01:48.330
Let's tackle the first one that is rule number one worst case.

01:48.420 --> 01:50.050
Let's talk about that in the next video.
