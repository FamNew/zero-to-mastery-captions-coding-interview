When a program executes it has two ways to remember things.

00:07.600 --> 00:18.020
The heap and the stack the heap is usually where we store variables that we assign values to and the

00:18.020 --> 00:24.790
stack is usually where we keep track of our function calls.

00:24.840 --> 00:32.600
Sometimes we want to optimize for using less memory instead of using less time talking about memory

00:32.630 --> 00:34.220
or space complexity.

00:34.340 --> 00:37.540
Is very similar to talking about the time cost.

00:37.610 --> 00:44.570
We simply look at the total size relative to the size of the input and see how many new variables or

00:44.570 --> 00:47.150
new memory we're allocating.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.740
How much memory is being used.

00:49.790 --> 00:51.850
So let's look at an example.

00:52.190 --> 00:58.640
Up to this point we've talked about time complexity and how if we want to compress let's say some boxes

00:59.210 --> 01:03.640
we just talked about how fast and how many operations this would take.

01:03.950 --> 01:12.800
But in real life there's this other factor of memory and we have this pink little box of how much this

01:12.980 --> 01:17.410
function can take how much input it's able to take.

01:17.510 --> 01:25.790
For example if we had eight hundred of boxes that we have to create to run this function well has limited

01:25.790 --> 01:29.320
capacity and it might overflow.

01:29.480 --> 01:35.660
By the way things like Stack Overflow is something we're going to be talking about and how it's an issue

01:35.660 --> 01:40.300
when it comes to memory something we'll cover when we get into recursion.

01:41.310 --> 01:45.300
What causes this space complexity.

01:45.300 --> 01:50.060
Well luckily for you I added this to our chichi.

01:50.250 --> 01:59.250
What causes space complexity while adding variables adding data structures like arrays objects hash

01:59.250 --> 02:06.290
tables again things will talk about function calls and allocations.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.280
You don't need this PIERI.

02:08.500 --> 02:14.290
But let's actually code something and show you an example in the next video.

02:14.320 --> 02:21.010
We'll go through some space complexity exercises and figure out how we can give the go notation to the

02:21.010 --> 02:21.520
subject.
