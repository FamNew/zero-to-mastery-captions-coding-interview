00:01.500 --> 00:10.620
In my opinion this section is one of the most important topics for any software developer or engineer.

00:10.620 --> 00:17.850
It also happens to be my favorite section of course no matter what company you work in where you live

00:17.940 --> 00:24.360
or even if you're coding 10 years from now this is a concept that will be around for a long time and

00:24.360 --> 00:27.780
something that will truly make you a better developer.

00:28.970 --> 00:35.480
Big-O is something that I learned about two to three years into my career as a developer and it's so

00:35.480 --> 00:36.500
important.

00:36.500 --> 00:42.560
It has made me a better developer a better engineer and it will for you as well.

00:42.590 --> 00:52.100
Big companies like Google Facebook Alibaba Amazon all know this which is why you won't get by any of

00:52.100 --> 00:57.620
their interviews any of their phone interviews any of their screaming interviews without encountering

00:57.620 --> 00:58.400
this topic.

00:59.230 --> 01:03.490
So we're going to learn all about this very important topic and that's why it's at the beginning of

01:03.490 --> 01:04.960
the course.

01:04.960 --> 01:05.530
All right.

01:05.620 --> 01:07.110
Did I grab your attention enough.

01:07.970 --> 01:10.480
So what are we talking about here.

01:10.490 --> 01:17.480
It's called Big O and the official term is Big O asymptomatic analysis.

01:17.660 --> 01:22.150
If you want to sound super smart and impress your friends you see any coater.

01:22.220 --> 01:24.610
Given enough time can solve a problem.

01:24.980 --> 01:28.910
What matters is though how well the problem is solved.

01:29.330 --> 01:31.920
And this is where big-O can help us.

01:31.970 --> 01:34.920
It can tell us how well a problem is solved.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.130
We're going to find out about what that means.

01:37.130 --> 01:43.580
In this section we're going to talk about big-O what it is how we define it and then we're going to

01:43.580 --> 01:52.900
use big-O and it's different notation to distinguish that code from good code good code from great code.

01:53.110 --> 01:57.950
We are going to become comfortable with this topic that we are going to not be surprised when this comes

01:57.950 --> 01:59.290
up in our interviews.

01:59.450 --> 02:05.090
But we're also going to build this big foundation that is important to be a great developer.

02:05.090 --> 02:10.160
The reason this topic is at the beginning of this course is that you will see this Big-O notation come

02:10.160 --> 02:16.160
up again and again as we go into topics such as data structures and algorithms.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.360
Like I said this is my favorite section.

02:18.380 --> 02:21.170
So get ready because it's going to be a lot of fun.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.910
See you in the next video.

02:22.960 --> 02:23.150
Bob.
