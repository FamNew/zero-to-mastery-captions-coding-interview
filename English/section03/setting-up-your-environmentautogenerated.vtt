00:01.390 --> 00:08.340
In this course I don't want to limit you to just one language because we all code in different languages

00:08.430 --> 00:13.490
and throughout your career you're most likely going to use multiple languages.

00:13.530 --> 00:20.430
Now this course specifically I will have to use a language to demonstrate code and write some code and

00:20.430 --> 00:27.000
I'm going to use javascript for this because it is similar with a lot of common languages and it's also

00:27.000 --> 00:28.650
the most well known.

00:28.830 --> 00:36.330
However you can use whatever language you want in this course and follow along even the exercises will

00:36.330 --> 00:39.300
give you solutions in different languages.

00:39.300 --> 00:45.570
So pick whichever one you want but how are we going to run all these different languages when you're

00:45.570 --> 00:46.380
following along.

00:46.500 --> 00:51.810
Maybe I'm demonstrating something in javascript and you're coding along in Python what we're going to

00:51.810 --> 00:54.770
use a couple of neat little online tools.

00:54.840 --> 00:59.710
The first one I'm going to show you and the one we're going to use in this course is wrap all dot I-T

01:00.360 --> 01:02.260
REPL it as I like to call it.

01:02.550 --> 01:07.200
And you can pick any language you want here to code along.

01:07.590 --> 01:13.710
And like I said I'm going to be using javascript for this course but all you need to do is to sign up

01:13.770 --> 01:22.110
with your get habbe account and you'll have a little ID that you can run your code and you'll see me

01:22.200 --> 01:30.350
using this throughout the course and now the one that I really like is galat IO and it's open source

01:30.350 --> 01:36.680
which I'm a big fan of and you can see over here that we have a lot of different languages that we can

01:36.680 --> 01:37.150
use.

01:38.550 --> 01:45.730
Again if I go to Javascript it gives me a nice little area for me to write code and run it.

01:45.880 --> 01:53.960
Another option especially if you're using javascript is to just go to View developer and developer tools

01:54.430 --> 02:06.880
and Google Chrome and this allows you in the console tab to just write javascript.

02:06.890 --> 02:08.550
So that's another great option.

02:08.690 --> 02:15.920
Or if you prefer you can always use your favorite text editor write your code and then run it whichever

02:15.920 --> 02:17.970
way you want.

02:17.990 --> 02:23.310
Again keeping in mind that this course is language agnostic that means it doesn't matter what language

02:23.370 --> 02:23.960
you use.

02:23.970 --> 02:29.010
What we're learning our foundational computer science principles say you can take anywhere throughout

02:29.010 --> 02:35.910
your career and as you'll see whether you know javascript or not I'm going to keep the code very general

02:35.940 --> 02:42.600
and simple so that it's easy to replicate it into other languages and also give you resources and sources

02:42.900 --> 02:44.000
with other languages.

02:44.010 --> 02:46.700
When we get into more nitty gritty coding.

02:46.850 --> 02:48.980
All right set up your environment.

02:49.050 --> 02:50.500
Get ready for some code.

02:50.790 --> 02:52.770
I'll see in the next video.
