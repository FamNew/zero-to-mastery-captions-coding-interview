00:00.860 --> 00:06.740
Now that we have a better understanding of how to calculate bego let's look at another exercise that

00:06.740 --> 00:09.850
should be a little bit easier than the first one that we did.

00:10.310 --> 00:21.170
What would you say that the big show of this is well if we go one by one we see here that we have of

00:21.170 --> 00:25.680
one again of one.

00:25.950 --> 00:30.420
And you know what if I keep typing this is going to get tiresome so I'm just going to copy and paste

00:30.420 --> 00:32.150
so all of one here.

00:32.190 --> 00:43.930
We're just assigning variables and then we also see here that we have a for loop that is running based

00:43.930 --> 00:45.030
on the input.

00:45.160 --> 00:50.770
We don't know what that input is but we can just assume that we're looping based on however long this

00:50.770 --> 00:54.370
input is in which case we're running each one of these

00:58.900 --> 01:02.820
of end times or whatever long the input is.

01:02.830 --> 01:09.410
So again these are going to be run of in and of end times.

01:09.700 --> 01:15.840
And if we go down here again same thing we don't know what the input is but these are being run off

01:15.870 --> 01:21.530
and times and then finally this last line is just run once.

01:21.790 --> 01:25.660
So it'll be all of one.

01:25.660 --> 01:38.580
So looking at this function another fun challenge function we see that are all in our Big O is 1 2 3

01:38.880 --> 01:39.560
4.

01:39.640 --> 01:50.360
So we have four plus because we're just adding up the steps year we have of and that's happening 1 2

01:50.420 --> 01:54.760
3 4 5 so 5 and

01:57.610 --> 02:08.190
so the big O here is we have four costs and times and then five things that we're doing anti-CPS or

02:08.190 --> 02:11.700
however long the input is all right.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.360
That wasn't so bad was it compared to the first time around.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.750
I think you're starting to get the hang of this.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.540
So let's dive into the next video.

02:18.600 --> 02:25.260
Let's start to figure out how we can simplify things for us so that we're not doing this mathematical

02:25.260 --> 02:27.020
step by step count.

02:27.150 --> 02:28.990
I'll see in the next video Bob.
