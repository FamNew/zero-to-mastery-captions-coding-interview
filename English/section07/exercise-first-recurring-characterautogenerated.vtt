Welcome back.

00:02.560 --> 00:10.140
It's time for an exciting interview question and this question comes straight from Google given energy.

00:10.480 --> 00:13.080
Let's say that looks like this.

00:13.150 --> 00:16.110
Tell me the first recurring character.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.260
What does that mean.

00:17.500 --> 00:23.660
Well if we look at this array over here I want a function that I can enter this array.

00:23.920 --> 00:31.030
This input is going to look through all the numbers and tell me which one gets repeated first.

00:31.480 --> 00:40.980
So we look at 2 5 1 and 2 and we say two has already been seen.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.570
Two is the recurring number.

00:44.550 --> 00:49.360
If we look at another example we see 2 1 1 and 0.

00:49.410 --> 00:55.360
We stop here because 1 we've already seen before we can say the first recurring character is 1.

00:55.800 --> 01:03.560
If we get an array that has all unique items we just return undefined.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.980
So how would you go about solving this.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.590
Give it a go see what you come up with.

01:10.320 --> 01:16.530
If you need help perhaps score on discord and chat with some of the community members and I'll see you

01:16.680 --> 01:17.630
in the solution video.
