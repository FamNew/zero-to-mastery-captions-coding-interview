Welcome back why hash tables hash tables are great when you want quick access to certain values.

00:09.580 --> 00:14.930
Remember that searching through an array for an item takes a really long time.

00:14.930 --> 00:21.380
We have to loop through every item and see if a certain string or a certain number is in an array with

00:21.380 --> 00:22.300
hash tables.

00:22.310 --> 00:24.950
That's really really fast.

00:25.100 --> 00:29.410
And this is why you see hash tables in places like databases right.

00:29.450 --> 00:33.500
We want to search for something in a database and it gives it back to us right away.

00:34.360 --> 00:44.620
Similarly inserting items in and a hash table unlike an array that might shift indexes is typically

00:45.020 --> 00:46.020
of one.

00:46.450 --> 00:50.260
You just simply have to hash and create the key.

00:50.260 --> 00:55.450
Although we have those cases of collision most of the time that's something that we don't need to worry

00:55.450 --> 00:56.170
about too much.

00:56.170 --> 00:59.940
And we can assume and answered of all one.

01:00.120 --> 01:05.430
Then there's other aspects that are quite similar between the two arrays let you quickly look up the

01:05.430 --> 01:12.870
value for a given key keys are called indexes in an array and we don't get to pick them it's always

01:12.870 --> 01:21.170
0 1 2 3 in hash tables we can pick them so hash tables is kind of like a hack on top of an array to

01:21.170 --> 01:31.860
let us use flexible keys instead of being stuck with 0 1 2 3 a problem of hash tables that we discussed

01:32.010 --> 01:36.120
was the idea of no concept of order in arrays.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.810
Each item was placed next to each other on a shelf in memory.

01:40.930 --> 01:43.800
Hash tables are kind of placed all over the place.

01:45.560 --> 01:51.590
Now that we have an idea of the differences between the two I think it's time for us to actually work

01:51.590 --> 01:58.490
on some exercises and interview questions that we'll use hash tables and their answers.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.350
I'll see on that one.
