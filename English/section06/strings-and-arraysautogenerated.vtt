Welcome back.

00:02.020 --> 00:08.310
I wanted to add a quick video to let you know about a common interview trick we're going to be doing

00:08.310 --> 00:11.200
some array questions after this.

00:11.610 --> 00:20.310
But in interviews you should treat any string questions like over here as an array question you see

00:20.410 --> 00:24.730
strings are simply array of characters.

00:24.790 --> 00:31.760
Most of the time in an interview when you get a question like reverse a string you should be thinking

00:31.820 --> 00:40.880
is to convert this into an array do some sort of loop on it or an operation using something like a split

00:40.940 --> 00:45.250
method in javascript and then returning it as a string.

00:45.470 --> 00:52.980
After you've finished the operations with them so that is a very common interview question where you're

00:52.980 --> 00:54.060
manipulating strings.

00:54.060 --> 00:57.880
Just keep that in mind and will actually demonstrate this in the next video.

00:57.960 --> 01:03.180
When we do a very common interview question I'll see you in that one.

01:03.480 --> 01:03.780
Bebai.
