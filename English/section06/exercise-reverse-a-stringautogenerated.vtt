00:00.710 --> 00:01.750
We'll come back.

00:01.780 --> 00:04.690
Let's get into some fun interview questions.

00:04.690 --> 00:10.570
We're going to start off with a very very common one and it shouldn't be too complicated to start us

00:10.570 --> 00:11.860
off.

00:11.890 --> 00:18.780
The interviewer asks you can you create a function that reverses a string.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.040
So if you passed into this function right here.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.560
Hi my name is Andre.

00:25.830 --> 00:30.030
It should return this jibberish that is.

00:30.260 --> 00:36.670
Oh and I forgot and here is jibberish.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.520
That is all backwards.

00:39.700 --> 00:43.000
It's just simply reversing a string.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.280
Now I want to go ahead and try this in your own REPL thought id or whichever text editor you use and

00:51.280 --> 00:53.620
see if he can think through the problem.

00:54.420 --> 00:59.750
Use what you know about arrays to solve this.

00:59.760 --> 01:05.570
Now keep in mind when it comes to questions like this there are many ways to do things.

01:05.730 --> 01:12.630
As programmers we know this rate there are so many ways to solve a problem and depending on our style

01:12.720 --> 01:17.030
our knowledge and time we're going to come up with different solutions.

01:17.040 --> 01:22.660
So if your answer is different than mine well that's not the worst thing.

01:22.990 --> 01:28.150
You want to be able to do is to think through a problem and understand why you made those decisions.

01:28.170 --> 01:33.180
So go ahead reverse a string and I'll see you in the solution video.
