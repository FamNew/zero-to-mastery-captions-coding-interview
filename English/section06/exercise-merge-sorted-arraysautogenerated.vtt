Welcome back.

00:01.870 --> 00:12.960
It's time to do another fun or re interview question an interviewer asks you given to a race that are

00:12.960 --> 00:21.520
sorted can you merge these two arrays into one big one that's still sorted.

00:21.620 --> 00:30.170
So if I have a function called merge sorted or race and I give it two parameters with two sorted arrays

00:31.010 --> 00:33.000
can you make it so that every turns.

00:33.080 --> 00:39.910
0 3 4 4 6 30 31 as you can see completely sorted.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.850
Let's see what you can come up with and I'll see you in the solution video by.
