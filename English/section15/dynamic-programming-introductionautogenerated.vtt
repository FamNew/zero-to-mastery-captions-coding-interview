Welcome to our last section on algorithm's the last missing piece and that is dynamic programming sounds

00:11.970 --> 00:14.190
very important doesn't it.

00:15.250 --> 00:24.340
With this section we're going to go over the very last piece of our mind map to complete our entire

00:24.340 --> 00:25.140
knowledge graph.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.100
So we're ready for interviews.

00:27.160 --> 00:34.480
It's this last little piece of dynamic programming specifically memorization that we're going to be

00:34.480 --> 00:35.410
talking about.

00:35.830 --> 00:44.380
But what is it Dynamic Programming is just an optimization technique.

00:44.520 --> 00:50.800
And here's a fun fact dynamic programming actually means nothing.

00:50.940 --> 00:55.610
It's completely garbage buzzword and I'm not kidding here.

00:55.730 --> 01:01.530
All linked to a funny article on how the name came to be but dynamic programming at the end of the day

01:01.530 --> 01:07.420
is just an optimization technique using something called caching.

01:07.460 --> 01:14.120
If you have something that you can cache Well then he can use dynamic programming.

01:14.130 --> 01:20.130
Now we're going to get into the details of what that means throughout the next videos but at a higher

01:20.130 --> 01:28.260
level dynamic programming is a way to solve problems by breaking it down into a collection of subproblems

01:28.740 --> 01:35.040
solving each of those solve problems just once and storing their solutions in case.

01:35.040 --> 01:42.960
Next time the same subproblem occurs but let's get into that and understand what it means how we can

01:42.960 --> 01:48.450
implement it to become better interviewers better engineers and better programmers.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.740
I'll see in the next video by.
