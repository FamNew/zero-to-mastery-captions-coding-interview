00:00.750 --> 00:09.340
In order to solve coing problems we need to learn these data structures and these algorithms.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.900
It doesn't look that bad does it.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.500
Here's the big secret.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.620
There are a lot more data structures in this and a lot more algorithms than this.

00:19.390 --> 00:26.500
But just like when you learn a new language you don't read through the dictionary and learn every single

00:26.500 --> 00:28.590
word in that dictionary.

00:28.600 --> 00:34.170
And that language Instead you focus on being able to communicate with others.

00:34.210 --> 00:37.700
You only focus on things that are being used most of the time.

00:37.960 --> 00:43.240
And when it comes to data structures and algorithms these are where you're going to get asked on and

00:43.240 --> 00:50.710
interviews because these are the ones that get used the most and 90 percent of the time to solve a really

00:50.710 --> 00:54.100
complex problem you're only using these things.

00:54.130 --> 00:55.560
It doesn't look that bad does it.

00:55.900 --> 01:02.340
All you need is the base line skills and companies just want to know that you've prepared for the interview

01:02.340 --> 01:04.300
and can succeed within their system.

01:05.200 --> 01:10.330
A lot of people complain about coding interviews or white board interviews and how useless they are

01:10.330 --> 01:15.880
because they never use some of these algorithms or data structure in their day to day job.

01:17.090 --> 01:21.550
But they're just a way to weed out people that aren't willing to work hard.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.720
Look at this as an advantage.

01:24.870 --> 01:27.200
Not many people work on their interview questions.

01:27.300 --> 01:32.220
You're going to work harder than 99 percent of the people out there because you know that getting a

01:32.220 --> 01:36.280
good job will have a big impact on your life.

01:36.450 --> 01:38.310
And I mean that's why you're taking the course.

01:38.430 --> 01:42.420
And as you see here the good news is that it's not as hard as you think.

01:42.420 --> 01:49.800
You just have to put your time and effort into the right things as long as we learn our right data structures.

01:49.890 --> 01:54.360
When and why to use them how to implement them how to solve problems with them.

01:54.360 --> 02:02.580
And same with algorithms and we combine it with our cheat sheet that I'll create for you when we compare

02:02.580 --> 02:04.520
our code that is readable.

02:04.680 --> 02:11.780
That is memory efficient and time efficient using big-O between these two.

02:12.060 --> 02:16.460
That's all interviews are that's all coding interviews ask for.

02:16.920 --> 02:24.300
If we go back to our online over the course we're now getting into the technical interview section.

02:24.630 --> 02:29.790
And when I click over here it's going to look overwhelming at first and we're going to go over this

02:29.790 --> 02:32.810
diagram so it all makes sense.

02:32.880 --> 02:37.310
We're going to talk about different data structures that we have.

02:37.410 --> 02:38.780
Let's zoom in a bit here.

02:39.790 --> 02:44.620
You can see we're going to talk about arrays trees stacks and graphs and a lot more.

02:44.620 --> 02:48.640
We're going to talk about the big O of each one of these data structures.

02:48.700 --> 02:54.610
We're going to talk about different algorithms when to use what and like I said this is going to look

02:54.640 --> 03:01.030
overwhelming at first but we're going to go through this step by step so that at the end all of this

03:01.030 --> 03:02.450
makes sense to you.

03:02.470 --> 03:10.650
We're also going to use the cheat sheet right over here to help us solve these coding problems.

03:10.690 --> 03:15.060
Now in this cheat sheet we've already covered the three pillars of good code.

03:15.070 --> 03:21.070
We already talked about what skills the interviewer is looking for but we haven't talked about this

03:21.400 --> 03:23.770
part.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.870
So let's start with this section in the next video.
