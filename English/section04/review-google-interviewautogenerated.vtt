Hello to I know I know I know the last two videos were kind of long very Tagen and goal.

00:08.440 --> 00:13.060
If you weren't familiar with javascript maybe they were a little bit tougher.

00:13.060 --> 00:20.590
But the point was the process of solving a problem in a coding interview and over here I've created

00:20.590 --> 00:22.370
a little playground for you.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.560
You remember the Google interview video that I made you watch.

00:25.810 --> 00:32.710
Well I've implemented the solution that the interviewee created and here we have the naive solution

00:32.740 --> 00:41.650
which is the nested for loops and then a better solution that uses just one for loop at the expense

00:41.650 --> 00:45.730
of creating something in javascript called new set.

00:45.730 --> 00:48.470
I left this here for you for you to play around with.

00:48.640 --> 00:54.250
And if you want coded in your own language but I wanted to challenge you to see if he can implement

00:54.250 --> 01:02.200
this on your own just like the person in the Google interview did in your own language the naive approach

01:02.500 --> 01:07.640
and then the better approach and try to follow the steps as you code along.

01:07.840 --> 01:15.250
Even though you already know the answer even though you have watched the interview video by practicing

01:15.250 --> 01:24.250
the steps and how you go from the naive to the better solution by following these steps you're going

01:24.250 --> 01:26.340
to improve that being muscle.

01:26.350 --> 01:28.740
All right I'll see you in the next video.

01:29.070 --> 01:29.630
Bye bye.
