We'll welcome back we're going to do a fun little exercise here now instead of me just reading off what

00:07.520 --> 00:08.570
I wrote.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.430
I have a little ASP for you.

00:10.580 --> 00:16.160
You're going to use this cheat sheet and look at the step by step through a problem which is a 15 step

00:16.160 --> 00:21.380
guide of what you should do when you're in a coding interview to solve a problem.

00:21.740 --> 00:25.380
And I want you to use this as you watch a little video.

00:25.700 --> 00:33.150
Now this video is actually produced by Google and it demonstrates it's 24 men and so it's a little bit

00:33.150 --> 00:37.310
long but it demonstrates how you should answer a coding interview.

00:37.350 --> 00:42.660
And in my opinion this is the best coding interview that I've ever seen.

00:42.660 --> 00:49.590
Now I want you to watch this and keep in mind that because we have learned data structures and algorithms

00:49.590 --> 00:54.280
yet this is going to be quite difficult for you to understand.

00:54.630 --> 00:55.910
And that's the goal here.

00:55.980 --> 01:02.640
When you watch this it's going to be really really hard to follow the actual coding maybe some of the

01:02.640 --> 01:04.140
language that they use.

01:04.140 --> 01:09.180
I believe they're writing the code in C++ So if you don't know C++ it might be difficult but that's

01:09.180 --> 01:09.960
not the point.

01:09.960 --> 01:19.650
The point for you here is to watch this video but also read the step by step through a problem and see

01:19.650 --> 01:26.210
how the interview he in this case in this video follows these steps.

01:27.250 --> 01:34.580
And these steps are what you're going to do when you solve a problem in a coding interview.

01:34.600 --> 01:42.840
The fun thing is that at the end of this course we're going to revisit the video this video and you're

01:42.840 --> 01:47.130
going to notice a difference from this very first time you that you're going to watch this video to

01:47.130 --> 01:51.600
the very end where what the interviewee does become second nature.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.020
You understand what they're coding in what they're doing to solve the problem.

01:56.220 --> 02:03.450
And all these little steps so that I succeed if you completely get this video and you understand how

02:03.450 --> 02:11.370
to run a successful interview at a company like Google or any large company or maybe even start up depending

02:11.370 --> 02:12.280
on what you like.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.110
So to get started I'll be right back.

02:15.150 --> 02:16.740
You go watch this video.

02:16.740 --> 02:18.430
You follow the 15 steps.

02:18.750 --> 02:26.010
And after this we're going to do a little problem of our own and follow the guide the 15 step guide

02:26.220 --> 02:28.410
to solve our own little problem.

02:28.860 --> 02:30.430
I'll see in that one.

02:30.430 --> 02:30.690
Babai.
