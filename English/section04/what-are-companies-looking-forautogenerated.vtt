00:01.390 --> 00:04.550
So what are companies looking for.

00:04.550 --> 00:10.070
Most people tend to think it's just coding skills but as you can see here there's actually four things

00:10.070 --> 00:11.260
that they're looking for.

00:11.270 --> 00:17.540
One is analytic skills that is how can you think through a problem and analyze things.

00:17.540 --> 00:22.610
And when you're coding during an interview they want to hear your thought process and how you go from

00:22.820 --> 00:25.230
not knowing the answer to solving the problem.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.250
They're also looking at coding skills which is do you code well.

00:29.330 --> 00:33.680
Is your code clean well organized readable.

00:33.800 --> 00:40.010
They also want to obviously know their technical skills or technical knowledge that is do you know the

00:40.010 --> 00:41.000
fundamentals.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.310
Did you just memorize things or do you understand the pros and cons of different solutions.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.520
And then finally your communication skills.

00:51.530 --> 00:55.320
Does your personality match the company's personality.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.100
Can you communicate well with others with the team most likely you won't be working by yourself.

01:00.110 --> 01:06.740
You're working with others with other teams with bosses with managers and they want to know whether

01:06.740 --> 01:11.270
you're the type of person that's going to fit well and work well within the company.

01:11.270 --> 01:18.270
Again most people get hung up on the idea of learning every single algorithm data structure doing a

01:18.280 --> 01:20.870
thousand problems to practice before an interview.

01:20.960 --> 01:27.500
And these are important but in most companies you don't actually need to know how to write a binary

01:27.500 --> 01:32.050
search tree or write a sorting algorithm from scratch.

01:32.060 --> 01:37.490
I mean we're going to go through that in this course but most of the time you learn it on the go on

01:37.490 --> 01:39.700
the job when you actually need it.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.120
And let's be honest.

01:41.150 --> 01:46.850
As engineers we know that most of the time when a problem presents itself we're good at searching the

01:46.850 --> 01:49.040
web on Google for answers.

01:49.130 --> 01:52.790
Not a single one of us has everything memorized in our head.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.120
Companies notice.

01:54.350 --> 01:55.330
They're not dumb.

01:55.610 --> 02:00.980
What they're looking for are people who know how to look for answers and they want to know that you

02:00.980 --> 02:05.220
know your data structures and algorithms and you know of their existence.

02:05.270 --> 02:06.290
That's the key.

02:06.350 --> 02:11.610
They want to know when you should use a certain data structure over the other.

02:11.630 --> 02:15.220
Why should we use a certain algorithm over another.

02:15.290 --> 02:17.480
At the end of the day companies want smart people.

02:17.510 --> 02:22.180
They want people that can solve problems that they cannot solve themselves because that's what they're

02:22.180 --> 02:26.770
paying you and having worked at companies and also hiring people.

02:26.810 --> 02:32.450
It's surprisingly hard to find people that can solve problems themselves without holding their hand

02:32.510 --> 02:36.190
or walking them through a problem entirely.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.600
So moving forward I ask you to just do this one simple thing.

02:41.090 --> 02:45.880
Do all the exercises in the course pause the videos if you need to rewash the videos.

02:45.920 --> 02:51.030
If you need do you need to understand the why of doing things why are we learning this.

02:51.050 --> 02:53.410
Why is this the answer to the problem.

02:53.510 --> 02:56.240
Why is this answer better than the other.

02:56.270 --> 02:59.210
Again don't worry we're going to practice this muscle throughout.

02:59.480 --> 02:59.910
OK.

03:00.140 --> 03:03.160
Let's dive into the next video to see where we're going to learn.

03:03.170 --> 03:04.850
I'll see in the next video bye.
