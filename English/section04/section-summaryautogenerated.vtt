00:00.990 --> 00:02.070
All right.

00:02.210 --> 00:03.960
Another section done.

00:04.340 --> 00:10.400
And in this section we talked about the technical interviews and how to solve problems specifically.

00:10.550 --> 00:15.470
One big misconception is that you're either a good problem solver or you aren't.

00:15.500 --> 00:21.390
But as with anything it's a muscle that you can train that you can practice.

00:21.390 --> 00:27.530
So with enough practice and knowing the tips and tricks that we covered in this section you can solve

00:27.530 --> 00:29.610
problems a lot better.

00:29.630 --> 00:33.530
That shows the interviewer you know what you're talking about.

00:33.530 --> 00:40.910
The key in this section was this cheat sheet and the step by step walk through of a problem.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.530
We looked at how a Google interview might look like.

00:44.570 --> 00:49.970
And then we mimicked some of the techniques used there to solve our own problem.

00:49.970 --> 00:56.960
The idea was to show how you work think out loud and try to comment the steps as you go along to solve

00:56.960 --> 01:03.770
a problem communicating throughout the process as much as possible and not worrying about finishing

01:03.770 --> 01:08.660
a problem fast is the key to intervening in solving problems.

01:08.660 --> 01:16.040
In an interview now we should have also gotten the idea that we don't want to memorize problems because

01:16.430 --> 01:23.150
if you do a hundred problems and try to memorize them well it won't really help you long term but you're

01:23.150 --> 01:24.550
also taking a gamble right.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.400
You're hoping the interviewer asks you a question that you've seen before.

01:29.750 --> 01:36.110
Instead we want to take control of our destiny and practice and be ready for anything by building the

01:36.110 --> 01:38.270
fundamentals.

01:38.420 --> 01:45.110
We talked about how by using the big show and the lessons we learned here we can now move on to data

01:45.110 --> 01:51.010
structures and algorithms and use them during our code interviews.

01:51.020 --> 01:56.660
We also talked about some of the skills that interviewers are looking for and demonstrated how it wasn't

01:56.660 --> 01:58.370
necessarily just coding skills.

01:58.520 --> 02:04.580
There's a lot of other aspects that interviewers are looking for and we cover these items and how to

02:04.580 --> 02:05.300
show them.

02:05.480 --> 02:14.020
During our practice into requestion finally we're now ready to dive into the exciting part of data structures

02:14.050 --> 02:15.230
and algorithms.

02:15.250 --> 02:22.630
We have a nice foundation and we know that all we need is to learn these data structures and algorithms

02:22.930 --> 02:29.470
to really be interview ready and we're also going to be using the cheat sheet that I gave you in this

02:29.470 --> 02:31.790
section throughout the rest of the course.

02:31.960 --> 02:39.040
And at the foundation of this cheat sheet is the idea of readability of code space complexity of code

02:39.490 --> 02:42.370
and time complexity of code.

02:42.600 --> 02:48.060
And although we don't cover everything in the cheat sheet we have a few items here at the end.

02:48.210 --> 02:53.850
You'll see that as we go through the data structure and algorithm questions certain type of patterns

02:54.030 --> 03:01.170
will emerge that although questions may be different in an interview usually the way to optimize things

03:01.410 --> 03:10.480
or tricks to make your answers better can be narrowed down to specific steps.

03:10.650 --> 03:12.030
So don't get overwhelmed.

03:12.030 --> 03:17.260
There's an easy clear checklist and heuristics that we're going to go over later on.

03:17.640 --> 03:23.110
But by this point I think we're ready to move on to data structures and algorithms.

03:23.340 --> 03:30.900
How do we write good code create good programs create value for the companies that we're interviewing

03:30.900 --> 03:32.480
for.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.720
See you in the next section.
