Walk them back one of the most common interview questions when it comes to cues and stacks is this one.

00:08.530 --> 00:12.360
Implement a cue using stacks.

00:12.590 --> 00:19.080
The Yep you can implement cues using stacks.

00:19.260 --> 00:25.380
And it's especially easy if you create a stack using a race.

00:25.410 --> 00:34.170
Now this question is on Leatt code which is really really nice because we're able to see the solutions

00:35.720 --> 00:40.360
explained as well as solutions in different languages.

00:40.400 --> 00:50.850
If you go to discuss and type in let's say javascript we get solutions that people have submitted DNC

00:50.940 --> 00:54.750
votes as well of the answer of how to do this.

00:54.900 --> 00:59.140
If you want to check Python because let's say you are writing in Python.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.780
Well they have that too.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.360
Any language you want you can find here.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.900
Now I have the answer for you as well.

01:09.980 --> 01:17.330
And in this video right around here and the available resources you'll see a REPL with my answer on

01:17.330 --> 01:18.350
it.

01:18.350 --> 01:23.380
But I want to challenge you and pretend you are in an interview to implement.

01:23.390 --> 01:24.860
Q Using stacks.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.440
How would you go about doing it.

01:27.800 --> 01:34.560
You can actually even coded on the lead code website if you want using whichever language you want.

01:34.560 --> 01:41.810
And just a heads up here if you are using javascript that they use the prototype way of adding methods

01:42.510 --> 01:48.180
but the class syntax that I showed you is the newer version.

01:48.210 --> 01:49.310
It's underneath the hood.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.280
It's the exact same thing as doing dot prototype.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.820
However it just looks cleaner using the class syntax.

01:55.860 --> 01:59.300
So that's why we did so good luck with that.

01:59.310 --> 02:03.180
Have fun and I'll link to the solution code for you.

02:03.910 --> 02:04.500
Right over here.
