Welcome back.

00:02.310 --> 00:10.440
We just implemented our own stack and hopefully you're able to code along as well in your own language.

00:10.440 --> 00:19.480
Now here's my next challenge to you what if we used a race for this stack up until this point or what

00:19.480 --> 00:24.580
we've coded in has been with a linked list that we've created.

00:24.580 --> 00:28.330
How would you change the code if you want to implement this in an array.

00:29.270 --> 00:35.360
And the hint here is that it's going to be super super simple it's going to involve deleting a lot of

00:35.360 --> 00:40.560
this code because while arrays already have PUSH and POP.

00:40.720 --> 00:48.260
So my challenge to you is to convert this stack data structure to use arrays instead of linked lists.

00:49.040 --> 00:52.190
Good luck and I'll see in the next video.

00:52.280 --> 00:52.550
Buh-Bye.
