Welcome back.

00:02.490 --> 00:09.270
Let's do a quick exercise before we actually create our own stacks and Qs because javascript doesn't

00:09.270 --> 00:13.810
have its own stock or cues data structure.

00:13.830 --> 00:18.950
Now I mentioned that there's two ways that we can build stacks and Qs.

00:19.150 --> 00:24.040
If we talk about stacks we can think of it as our browser history.

00:24.040 --> 00:33.430
Let's say we visit Google first then we visit you Dammy dot com and then we visit let's say YouTube

00:34.770 --> 00:39.130
in a stack because Google was the first item.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.240
It would actually be placed on the stack like this.

00:43.240 --> 00:52.170
Then we go to you Dammy so we'd be placed on the stack on top and then we go to YouTube.

00:52.240 --> 00:59.770
Now if we want to go to a new website let's say we go to Twitter but then we decided no no no that's

00:59.770 --> 01:00.700
not what I want to do.

01:00.700 --> 01:07.750
I want to go back well we remove Twitter press backburn on our browser and we get to YouTube if we press

01:08.110 --> 01:09.050
back again.

01:09.250 --> 01:19.940
We get to Dammy and then back again we go back to Google so Stax has a top and a bottom and we can build

01:19.940 --> 01:25.190
it with either array's or linked lists.

01:26.370 --> 01:35.940
My question to you is why would we want to build stacks with arrays that is will create a class of stacks

01:35.940 --> 01:43.120
that has the data being held in arrays versus using linked lists and vice versa.

01:43.910 --> 01:45.560
Think about that.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.840
What about.

01:48.840 --> 01:56.970
Let's say we have a Q I'm creating a waitlist app and and here we have a couple of people that want

01:56.970 --> 01:58.020
to get on the waitlist.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.680
The first person that shows up is Tim.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.690
And then after Tim or you know what.

02:04.770 --> 02:10.530
Let's use our names let's use Matt and then Matt shows up.

02:10.630 --> 02:20.550
But all of a sudden joy comes and lines up and then perhaps we have something that comes and waits in

02:20.550 --> 02:25.240
line and then we have Pavol.

02:25.460 --> 02:33.560
In this case we want Matt to be first then Joy and sumir then Powell and with cues we can once again

02:33.650 --> 02:40.160
use our race and length lists to implement it.

02:41.690 --> 02:44.900
Which one do you think will be better for us.

02:44.930 --> 02:47.480
Is there one better or are they both equal.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.210
I want you to think about this in the next video.

02:50.240 --> 02:56.180
I'm going to answer this for you but I recommend taking time to think about what you know about arrays

02:56.180 --> 03:01.430
and linked lists and how they might benefit or might not benefit.

03:01.490 --> 03:03.360
Stacks and Qs.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.360
I'll see in the next video.
