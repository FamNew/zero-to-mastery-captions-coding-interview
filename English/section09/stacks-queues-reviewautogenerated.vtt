00:01.370 --> 00:08.960
And there we have it we've learned stacks and Qs and an easy way to remember them is just simply plates

00:09.380 --> 00:11.060
and our waiting line.

00:11.060 --> 00:16.390
We learned why they're built on top of other data structures like linked lists and arrays.

00:16.520 --> 00:22.970
And we also talked about how to build stacks with the Rays and length lists and also why we might not

00:22.970 --> 00:31.280
want to use an array to build queues and also built a new data structure with a linked list.

00:31.300 --> 00:37.840
We learned that stacks and queues are great for some fast operations that they have such as removing

00:37.840 --> 00:42.280
or inserting such as at the end of the data structure.

00:42.920 --> 00:50.550
We can also access the very first item in a queue or the very top item in a stack.

00:50.780 --> 00:58.490
And we also have all our data order which is really really nice but we don't usually use our stacks

00:58.490 --> 01:03.400
or cues to really do any sort of lock up or search through the data structure.

01:03.440 --> 01:07.670
All we're interested in is the end bits of the data structure.

01:07.670 --> 01:14.770
So they make it really useful by restricting our use of what we can do when it comes to stacks and queues.

01:14.900 --> 01:20.090
But making sure that what we're allowed to do with these data structures are going to be really really

01:20.090 --> 01:22.600
fast.

01:22.830 --> 01:24.060
And there we have it.

01:24.180 --> 01:28.520
We've continued to expand our mind map of data structures.

01:28.860 --> 01:31.290
So we completed our stacks.

01:31.290 --> 01:38.730
We learned how to create stacks with arrays and length lists we've learned about their Big O notation

01:39.180 --> 01:45.190
and we also talked about cues and how we would really want to use an array for a cue.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.840
A very common interview question.

01:48.150 --> 01:54.630
We learn how to use a linked list to create a queue and also we learned about the bego implications

01:55.140 --> 01:59.570
which is very similar to stacks.

01:59.670 --> 02:03.720
We're getting closer and closer to filling out this mind map.

02:03.930 --> 02:10.520
But before we do that we still have a few more data structures to go but the end is almost near.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.570
We only have trees and graphs to talk about.

02:14.650 --> 02:17.480
For that I'll see you in the next part.
