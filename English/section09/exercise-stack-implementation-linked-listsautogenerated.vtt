Welcome back.

00:02.110 --> 00:08.420
It's time to code our own stack and I have a little exercise for you here.

00:08.500 --> 00:14.140
I've created the template of what we want our stack data structure to look like.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.570
And we also have a class of node.

00:17.670 --> 00:23.100
If you decide to use that and you should be familiar with it from our linked lists exercise.

00:23.310 --> 00:27.770
Or you can just ignore it and create a new node yourself in here.

00:28.980 --> 00:34.380
Now this stack is going to have in its constructor three properties.

00:34.500 --> 00:42.870
We have the top which is remember the top plate we have the bottom which is the bottom plate and then

00:42.870 --> 00:50.430
we have a length of zero and both top and bottom are currently null.

00:50.440 --> 00:55.640
Now we're going to be using linked lists to fill these values.

00:56.360 --> 01:01.050
But we don't need to use the linked list class that we've used before.

01:01.070 --> 01:09.020
Instead you can just use the Node class to simply assign different values and make sure that the dot

01:09.230 --> 01:18.310
next points to a different node as we add things now your task is to create three methods that work

01:18.580 --> 01:27.030
for this data structure peak which lets us see the very top element or top node.

01:27.530 --> 01:38.330
The push which lets us add a node to the top of the stack and a pop which lets us remove from the top

01:38.330 --> 01:39.720
of the stack.

01:39.920 --> 01:47.120
And if you want to Optionally you can also do an is empty method which is common with the stack to check

01:47.150 --> 01:51.620
that our stack is empty.

01:51.680 --> 01:58.960
We'll start off with a my stack that gets instantiated and your code works.

01:58.960 --> 02:07.990
If we can do something like this where you say my stack dot push let's say Google then push you Dammy

02:08.290 --> 02:16.080
push discord just like a browser history and then you can pop discord and pop you Demy pop.

02:16.120 --> 02:21.860
Google Good luck and I'll see in the solution video bye.
