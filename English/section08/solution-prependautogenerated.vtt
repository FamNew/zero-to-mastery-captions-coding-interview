Welcome back were you able to implement Prebend.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.500
Let's have a look at what the code should look like.

00:09.270 --> 00:17.620
The very first thing we do just like we did with a pen is to create the note that we're going to add.

00:17.910 --> 00:23.460
So I'm going to say new node value and next.

00:23.490 --> 00:30.690
Now next year I'm going to leave as no and I'll show you why in the next video that is the case and

00:30.690 --> 00:33.930
we don't just have next equals to this.

00:33.930 --> 00:44.400
Dodd had to reference the very first item in our list which is 10 but for now just trust me that this

00:45.060 --> 00:47.490
we want to leave us no because we can do that later.

00:47.490 --> 00:52.000
Right now we're just creating an empty node with the value.

00:52.270 --> 01:04.750
Next we want to say that our new node dot next which is this value over here is going to equal this

01:04.960 --> 01:07.590
Dot had.

01:07.910 --> 01:14.040
So we've just created a pointer saying that the new no do we just created is going to point to this

01:14.310 --> 01:19.360
god head the very first item in our list.

01:19.360 --> 01:19.640
OK.

01:19.660 --> 01:20.950
That shouldn't make sense.

01:21.310 --> 01:25.780
And then obviously just like we did with append we want to update the reference.

01:25.780 --> 01:31.300
Now to say that this Dodd head is no longer equal to this all value.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.900
It's now the new node.

01:35.970 --> 01:43.890
And then finally we want to add this lenth and make sure we increase the length of our list.

01:43.920 --> 01:57.150
Finally if we return this our linked list we can say run and look at that we've prepended one to the

01:57.150 --> 01:59.050
very first item.

01:59.970 --> 02:10.080
On the list the head and that is now referencing 10 and the tail of our list is now 16.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.900
That wasn't too bad it was it in the next video.

02:13.910 --> 02:18.220
I want to talk about quickly about this new Noad code.

02:18.320 --> 02:24.820
We're repeating both in append and pre-picked and what we might want to do with it.

02:24.860 --> 02:25.540
I'll see that one.
