Welcome back.

00:01.590 --> 00:06.420
I have a fun little exercise for you and I know I call every single exercise fine.

00:06.570 --> 00:09.810
But I think this one is especially fun.

00:10.960 --> 00:20.020
Now one of the most popular interview questions when it comes to linked lists is to reverse a linked

00:20.350 --> 00:22.170
list.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.290
What I mean by that.

00:23.570 --> 00:28.190
Well an interviewer is going to say we have a length list here.

00:28.190 --> 00:36.620
How would you go about reversing this list if I have a list over here that is one 10 16 18.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.500
How can you make the list the link list.

00:40.340 --> 00:44.310
Go from 88 to 16 to 10 to 1.

00:44.330 --> 00:48.130
How would you reverse it and flip.

00:48.370 --> 00:55.120
And we're going to use a singly linked list for this exercise and all we want to do is create a new

00:55.120 --> 00:55.700
method.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.540
That is going to say reverse

01:01.330 --> 01:08.060
and this method in here will have to do some magic that will reverse this for us.

01:08.820 --> 01:15.720
Remember we're not just printing out an array we want a reversed linked list that now has 88 referencing

01:15.720 --> 01:23.870
16 that has a reference saying or pointing to 10 and 10 pointing to one and one pointing to no how would

01:23.870 --> 01:26.030
you go about doing this.

01:26.030 --> 01:29.830
Good luck with this exercise and I'll see you in the solution video.

01:29.830 --> 01:30.300
Bye bye.
