00:01.060 --> 00:02.280
Welcome back.

00:02.280 --> 00:04.020
It's time for a little exercise.

00:04.970 --> 00:13.990
Why do you think linked lists may be better than hash tables or erase just from what we know right now.

00:14.360 --> 00:20.570
I want you to answer this question in your head or write it down before you go into the next video.

00:21.370 --> 00:29.170
I also want to show you a nifty little tool that I will link to in this video and this little visual

00:29.170 --> 00:36.630
shows you how a linked list works so you can play around with it and see where they might shine.

00:36.630 --> 00:44.500
Over arrays or hash tables you see over here we have a head with a value of 22 and a tail with a value

00:44.500 --> 00:45.420
of eighty nine.

00:45.580 --> 00:53.560
And then other nodes connecting all of them and you can use this Web site to do anything to a linked

00:53.560 --> 00:54.220
list.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.130
You can create.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.990
You can search you can insert you can remove.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.050
Let's do a insert here.

01:00.880 --> 01:11.600
I can either insert to the head if I click here and if I click go I enter the value a 5 I can insert

01:11.630 --> 01:13.470
to the tail at the very end.

01:13.490 --> 01:19.210
If I had go all right that's seems pretty simple nothing too crazy.

01:19.210 --> 01:22.210
What if we insert somewhere in the middle.

01:22.210 --> 01:28.090
If I click over here and let's say an index of two I want to insert the value of 90 or less increase

01:28.090 --> 01:33.140
that to 93 I hit go keep an eye on what's about to happen

01:38.490 --> 01:40.230
oh boy what just happened.

01:41.030 --> 01:41.750
Don't worry.

01:41.930 --> 01:47.390
It looks a little bit complicated and we're actually going to code this all ourselves and build this

01:47.390 --> 01:47.750
in.

01:47.960 --> 01:54.500
But I want you to play around with this data structure and in your head come up with why we might want

01:54.500 --> 01:56.210
to use something like this.

01:56.270 --> 01:58.660
And then the next video I'm going to tell you all about it.

01:58.760 --> 02:02.200
So you can test whether your assumptions are correct.

02:02.270 --> 02:03.050
I'll see in the next one.
