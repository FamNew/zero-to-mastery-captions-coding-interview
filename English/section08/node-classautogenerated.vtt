Welcome back in the previous video we talked about how new Noad over here gets repeated both times in

00:09.480 --> 00:11.340
append and prepared.

00:11.560 --> 00:18.960
And as we create more methods on our linked list we're going to have to constantly say new node value

00:18.960 --> 00:20.110
calls value next.

00:20.130 --> 00:24.920
No and usually we want to keep things dry.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.530
That is do not repeat yourself in code.

00:28.530 --> 00:36.780
And many implementations of linked list you'll see something like this where new node is actually a

00:36.780 --> 00:38.170
nother class.

00:38.370 --> 00:45.100
For example I can create a new class here and this is how object oriented programming usually works.

00:45.880 --> 00:51.610
We have classes that interact with other classes to create our programs.

00:51.610 --> 00:57.150
So you'll see a lot of implementations of linked lists that have class of Node.

00:57.430 --> 01:05.800
And this note is going to have a constructor that takes a value and this value will have this darte

01:06.850 --> 01:16.670
value equals to value it's going to have this dot next equal to no

01:19.990 --> 01:20.750
just like that.

01:22.370 --> 01:32.380
So that way instead of us saying constant new node and creating this new node every time I can just

01:32.380 --> 01:45.760
say every time that I want to create a new node we can say lat or Konst new node equals to new node

01:46.150 --> 01:49.360
and then the value.

01:49.430 --> 02:02.040
So every time we have a new node we just instantiate what we call create and run this new node class

02:02.670 --> 02:09.520
that creates a node for us with a value property and a next property.

02:09.550 --> 02:17.650
So you might prefer using this syntax but because I find this can get a little bit confusing especially

02:17.650 --> 02:24.010
if you're now used to classes and want to just keep things the way they are because.

02:24.220 --> 02:32.000
Well I think it's easier to read and as you saw it's fairly easy to implement if you want to do that

02:32.030 --> 02:34.200
on your own OK.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.010
Just a quick segue.

02:36.260 --> 02:39.750
Let's get back to finishing our linked list in the next video.
